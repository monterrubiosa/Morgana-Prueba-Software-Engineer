                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My girlfriend and I went for dinner at Emerald Chinese after a Thursday night workout.\n\nWe arrived around 7:30pm and were seated after a short wait.  After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter, we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate (BBQ pork, chicken, and duck)\n\nThe food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious.  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct sauces.\n\nAfter the meal, we received fortune cookies for dessert.\n\n\nFood\nThe food was good quality.  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made.  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungry.\n\nPrice\nPrice is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine, and comparable to large western restaurant chains.\n\nService:\nThe service is average to slightly below average.  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiter/waitresses are overworked, impatient, unattentive.  Emerald Chinese is no exception.  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient.  All our services needs were met, but the staff was rushed and grumpy..\n\nDecor\nEmerald has tasteful decorations, comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths.  There is sufficient room to navigate between tables.\n\n\nOverall, we had a good meal with large portions, received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our meal.\n\n3.1 / 5.0&quot;,

We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed; I could understand if it was empty and the carts weren&#x27;t circulating but every table was full. It took a while to get drinks and other items (napkins). The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits, but they were acceptable.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.\n\nMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.\n\n*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. \n\nThe staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It&#x27;s what I expect.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you&#x27;d get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.\n\nThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat.&quot;,

We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes . The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for. The food was mediocre to good. Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty. Overall the experience was good.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic. All I can say is, it is total mayhem. There weren&#x27;t any lines during the time we were there, but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before. The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly. I can&#x27;t really blame them, I get it. When you have a good thing, capitalize on it. Though, this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I don&#x27;t particularly find enjoyable.\n\nThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good. When it comes to dim sum, they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant. Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish. Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be. Again, a symptom of the style of restaurant. \n\nService was perfunctory at best. Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares. Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it (in as few words as possible).\n\nOverall, 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be. But the food is actually not bad.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Because we are in Mississauga, I think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area. Me and my family used to come here a lot, but nowadays we all so busy that we come here less.\n\nThe dim sums here aren&#x27;t as fancy as the one in Mississauga China Town, but I don&#x27;t mind the look. I just mind about the taste.\n\nTips: only a few dim sum need to order. Most of them are pushed out.&quot;,

You will see people of all different races coming here.  This place is one of the chinese dim sum restaurants that white people like to come to.  \n\nThe food is decent, but it is pricey.  You can find much cheaper dim sum places elsewhere, but if you don&#x27;t speak chinese you will be more comfortable coming here. \n\nSometimes, depending on what time you come here, there will be barely any food coming around. \n\nDerek&quot;,

You&#x27;ll expect to wait 20-30 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group. I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but I&#x27;m used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and it&#x27;s definitely subpar service here! The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is coming.\n\nI only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the quality/selection of food is good.&quot;,

The food does not arrive until 20-30 minutes after ordering. Not only that but they did not provide the starter soup. \n\nWhen we question the servers about the wait time, we received some lip.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Good dim sum, not too expensive, out in Mississauga but worth the trip. \n\nOur family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger variety.\n\nI think it&#x27;s consistently good, not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh. When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn&#x27;t a wait because that meant the food usually sat around. Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants. \n\nI&#x27;m giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto it&#x27;s usually the place I think of first. But really maybe it should be 3.5?\n\nNot sure about the service or non-dim sum menu so this review is just for dim sum.\n\nI like anything with bbq pork, especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle, and baked bbq pork buns. I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.\n\nNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I&#x27;m describing the dishes... sorry but if you&#x27;ve been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out. Next time I go I&#x27;ll try to update the names.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is the second time I&#x27;ve ever been here and I was quickly reminded why I didn&#x27;t come back after the first time. I came on a weekend after the lunch rush so the restaurant wasn&#x27;t busy at all. Most of the dim sum I ordered I noticed was just pulled from a sitting cart so it needed to be warmed up - I believe they had to microwave it! The food is normal. You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price. Some dim sum items are $6 a plate which I don&#x27;t think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost. I almost fell off my chair when my $70 bill for 2 people arrived at the table. I won&#x27;t be returning here and wouldn&#x27;t recommend my friends to go here. It&#x27;s way overpriced.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We saw that the rating was not that high, but decided to stop by anyways. A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings, but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad service.\n\nWe got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us. We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils. It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some. Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted, he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someone&#x27;s attention.\n\nWe got beef changfen, shrimp dumplings, spinach moon dumplings, curry octopus and meatballs. The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside. The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender. Only the octopus had both flavor and texture.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My family(15+ ppl) and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday. We got there and the reservation was under my uncles&#x27; name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table.  The waitress was badgering us appetizers/soups but we didn&#x27;t know that it was extra.... most of it didn&#x27;t taste really good especially the tripe/liver which made me gag.The basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef, mushrooms, chow mein was really good though. However, the lack of customer service pissed me off. My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didn&#x27;t even have; the manager literally got up in my uncle&#x27;s face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that they&#x27;re going to call the police. That is not how you treat a customer.  We are never going back because of how we were treated. Overall: the food gets a 3/5 and customer service gets -2/5. I hope they don&#x27;t treat other customers like that.&quot;,

Meh, I wouldn&#x27;t really care however, they charged us for it?!? So I have to pay to eat dumplings that may prove to be a health concern?  \n\n...At least the washrooms were clean... :P&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I usually really like the dim sum here but my lunch here yesterday was a real letdown. We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but I&#x27;m told their dim sum is on till 4pm.\n\nThe har gow was the worst I&#x27;ve ever had, and I rarely get to say that about har gow. The shrimp was tiny, rubbery, and it tasted \&quot;off\&quot;. I was just glad we didn&#x27;t get sick off it. It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so I&#x27;m not sure if they used a bad batch, but if so it shouldn&#x27;t have been served in the first place. Another staple, the shiu mai, was also pretty bad. It was tasty usually but it was tiny and I&#x27;m not sure if it had any fish egg topping either. If it did, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable. The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year. Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing, there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it. We also ordered some fried pork &amp; veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold. The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess. Stuff like this should be basic! The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce. The xiao long bao was also decent.\n\nOverall, it seems like they&#x27;re skimping on everything that costs money now. Despite that, prices are higher than other dim sum spots. That&#x27;s not a good combination. I hope the owner recognizes this soon because it&#x27;d be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this path.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga. Don&#x27;t despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends, things move quickly. There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering system...so just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food. The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts. Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table. The food runs out quickly, so don&#x27;t wait for it to come around again, it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings), Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce. Try the Chinese greens, dumpling soup, and pork sesame seed buns. The spring rolls ( with meat filling) are awesome as well.\nThe best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays. Anytime after 2:00 p.m. is pointless as they will be out of most food items.&quot;,

I would have preferred ordering from a menu, but co-workers who aren&#x27;t dim sum regulars like the push-cart style so they can peek before ordering \n\nSelection -- good, aplenty on seafood dishes (steamed shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp with chives dumpling, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp with chives dumpling, .... you get the gist). They have all the usual suspects for dim sum. \n\nQuality -- okay. Because it&#x27;s always busy, we&#x27;ve not had un-fresh food. \n\nService -- so so. I think they try to be efficient, if not warm and attentive. The servers are always in such a rush, who&#x27;s got time to smile at or chat with you?! If you want something, just be assertive and flag someone down (in a polite way). \n\nWait Time -- avoid 11:45 - 12:45 peak lunch time. Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patience.&quot;,

I can understand that they might be busy, and need to move fast. Sometimes they respond to me, but they look the other way, I&#x27;m okay with that too. \n\nBut today we went, and I would ask people for tea, and cutlery and things, and they would put a grump face and storm away, only to come back with the minimal amount of things. \n\nI mean, we asked for hot sauce, and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyone&#x27;s bowls! I was shocked, and then so I asked for more bowls. And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl. (What about everyone else)\n\nSome other servers are quite nice. If you need anything, try to flag down the guy in the suit/tie or the ladies in the black blazers. Anyone else will just throw things at you (figuratively)\n\nThey also again, tried to put stuff on our table, and I had to tell them to take it back. When she was confused what i wanted, I got yelled at. \n\nI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better. It would be the managers serving you, not the others. \n\nNonetheless, the place is always packed full of the local asian folk, which is a good thing. I can understand why, it&#x27;s cheap, and the food is quite decent (they can cook the short ribs a bit more).  This time with 5 people, we paid $11 a person. \n\nIf it wasn&#x27;t for the only dim sum place in proximity, and my co-workers loving it so much, I wouldn&#x27;t come back. \nI really don&#x27;t need to be treated like a 2nd class citizen.&quot;,

This didn&#x27;t start off our meal on the right foot,\n\nWe choose a smaller &#x27;banquet&#x27; meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didn&#x27;t like the really big banquet dinners.  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in &#x27;service&#x27;.  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls.  This behaviour continued throughout the meal.  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table.  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishes.\n\nThough they weren&#x27;t outstanding or great.... all the dishes were fairly well executed.  Nothing was greasy, oily, underseasoned, overseasoned, or burnt.  Steamed fish was fresh and light.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist.  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy.  The lobster could be better... it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there.  All in all ... nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered.  \n\nIn comparison to the east end, this restaurant is probably just average but since we&#x27;re in Mississauga, it stands to be one of the better ones.  It&#x27;s too bad we don&#x27;t have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurant.&quot;,

Good food, the only Dim Sum in Mississauga with Sweet and Sour Pork Feet w/ Eggs (sounds gross, but its believed to be very nutrional, as the Vinegar in the soup helps purify the blood).&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is probably the most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Mississauga. Largely because of all the 1 star reviews for poor service. Despite this, the place constantly has line ups for their dim sum so they must be doing something right. I&#x27;ve honestly never had a bad dim sum dish here. Har gow, beef balls, sticky rice, lotus leaf rice, shiu mai, tofu with crab meat, congee, pig feet, etc.. Everything is great. The service is... plain spoken and frantic but that&#x27;s dim sum for you. It&#x27;s certainly not worse than other similar restaurants.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We used to go here quite a bit for dim sum, but lately we&#x27;ve been going elsewhere.  Today we found ourselves there for a last minute family dim sum brunch.  I was reminded of why we don&#x27;t really go there anymore...\n\n1)  The layout: Depending on where you sit, you may get hot dim sum fresh off the carts, or you may get that cart that has \&quot;onesies\&quot; of everything left over....which implies you may have to wait quite awhile for that one item you&#x27;ve been jonesing for.  You could order it too, but that can take some time.  \n\n2)  The quality:  Sometimes it&#x27;s good, sometimes it&#x27;s meh.  It&#x27;s rarely excellent. \n\n3)  The wait:  OMGoodness.  On a Sunday morning at noon, you can expect a hefty wait especially if you&#x27;re in a group larger than 4.  I don&#x27;t even attempt Saturday morning.  I&#x27;d have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but don&#x27;t quote me on that!\n\nI&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good place to go if you&#x27;re a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them.  But otherwise there are better options out there.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place is a hidden gem in Mississauga!  It might look a little rundown on the outside and the foods were absolutely legit and authentic.  Dim sum was outstanding; my family and I technically had stayed in Toronto for 4 days and we had dim sum over here twice already!  Yes, it was that good!  Presented with a wide variety of dim sum, savory and sweet, from the steamed buns to baked sago pudding dessert, wish I had more room in the stomach!  Dinner was not super duper but prices were reasonable and foods were not bad at all.&quot;,

Staff is friendly, but most of them don&#x27;t speak alot of English, but there&#x27;s one who speaks good English tho. I just don&#x27;t like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom, looks sketchy. There&#x27;s fish tanks with crab and other seafood...alive tho. And it right along where people sit down, and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet, that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like...why couldn&#x27;t they put this anywhere else?

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The phrase \&quot;looks can be deceiving\&quot; certainly applies here. Although the decor is nice with bright lights, white tablecloths and golden chair covers, it&#x27;s ultimate downfall is the food. \n\nThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried. Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls? Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart. Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing. Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin. These were very thick. \n\nI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a \&quot;shrimp biscuit\&quot;. I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground pork.\n\nThe staff were awful. Apart from yelling at each other from across the room, they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice. \n\nOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us. After asking for the fried noodles on her cart, she stamped our card, then said she would get us a warm plate. She disappeared, and we didn&#x27;t see her again. We were about to ask someone about this, when another lady came with a plate of noodles. They were microwaved!!!! \n\nI think it&#x27;s safe to say I&#x27;ll never come back here again. There are so many other good dim sum places (Richmond Hill/Markham) that are definitely worth the drive. Do yourself a favour and don&#x27;t eat here.&quot;,

Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted? Probably not, but I still enjoy it because it&#x27;s still one of the best, most popular, and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga (it&#x27;s always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion - it indicates food is always made fresh for customers). If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town, this place is it! There&#x27;s not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh &amp; hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period (many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet, so it may take away from the experience if you&#x27;ve never tried this).\n\nIf you&#x27;ve never been to dim sum, I think going here would be a good experience. It&#x27;s nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible. Some of the dishes I order regularly are: XO stir fried rice noodle rolls, spare ribs in black bean sauce, fried crab claw (a bit expensive, ~$5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure), fried seaweed roll.\n\nOnly negatives about this place could be: long wait times, not for people who dislike busy/loud environments, not for extremely starving people (you might have to wait if you can&#x27;t find something you like right away on a cart), specialty/large dishes are expensive, not very wheelchair accessible (I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurant/plaza isn&#x27;t that friendly for wheelchairs)&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Came here for dinner a few days ago. Ordered two dishes from the \&quot;create your own set dinner\&quot; menu - the braised beef brisket and tendon bowl and the soft scrambled eggs with seafood. Came with house soup (老火湯) and dessert (綠豆沙 and orange slices).\n\nThe braised beef was very good, if not a bit oily. The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked - not too mushy and not too crunchy. The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable (I would have expected a root vegetable, like carrots or turnips), but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquid.\n\nThe eggs were a bit uneven, with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked. The seafood (shrimp and scallop) was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily (but it&#x27;s kind of to be expected with this dish).\n\nThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soup.\n\nService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves. \n\nPrices were reasonable.\n\nOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents... but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if you&#x27;re willing to go all the way east to Markham/Scarborough/etc.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;You might need to be rude to eat.\n\nEmerald is a Chinese Restaurant that mainly serves as a banquet hall. The chairs are all covered with fake silk seat covers similar to an old banquet hall trying to look newer. This place is geared for very large groups. \n\nThe food is decent but the service is geared towards survival of the fittest. For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served. Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern. \&quot;Excuse me can we have some more mustard sauce\&quot;? might be the way you might ask for some sauce. Here, you might have to say \&quot;WHERE IS THE SAUCE?\&quot; \n\nBut if you don&#x27;t mind being rude (because they don&#x27;t) then you might like this place. Try sitting closer to the window if you can as the Dim Sum carts seem to frequent that area more.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Looking over the reviews, Emerald has mixed ratings. I can understand this. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice sit-down with little interaction with your server: you&#x27;re in the wrong place. If you&#x27;re not very good at saying No, lol you&#x27;re so screwed it&#x27;s not even funny.\n\nEmerald is (as has been described to me) a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place. This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers, YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON&#x27;T WANT IT. \n\nThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times, you just have to be patient. The ladies (never seen a dude wheeling the carts) will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table (for which you will be charged), so you have to say No multiple times. \n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin. I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily, the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different, so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I&#x27;d find growing between my toenails, but tasted like heaven should taste. Leave your inhibitions at home.\n\nIt is WELL worth it. I&#x27;m now a huge fan of pork dumplings (as seen in other posts) and glazed pork buns! I can even order for myself now without going all doe-eyed in the face of the waiters! (I&#x27;m pretty proud of that)\n\nTL;DR: Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this. Learn to say No. Leave your inhibitions at home.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Went here today for lunch with my mom, who just moved in to the adjacent condominium complex behind the restaurant. \n\nThis. Place. Sucked. I mean really bad.\n\nMy first instinct this was going to be a rough ride was the fact they there was no appetizing aroma either outside or when opening the front doors. My second instinct? The decor... Weird looking yellow chairs, ceiling has water/mold stains and the TV is showing Slice.\n\nWe were taken to our table by a middle-aged Asian man, who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language, as he spoke like Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty. Then another manager, this time a female, approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings. We said yes, but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart, that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  \n\nNow, as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout, there is a price hike, supposedly because you are getting more food, so don&#x27;t be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.\n\nThe rice was just plain crap. No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice. The vegetables were the size of my fist (exaggerated), but damn folks, could you not cut them down to a manageable size?!\n\nAll that and I&#x27;m now $40 in the hole. No tip either, since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste and/or try to shovel it off to someone else. Failing that, trying to recook it back to some forms of dignity.\n\nShame on whoever cooks the food there, seriously.\n\nThe only plus? The cashier was real cute.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Last Friday, my team from work went to Emerald for dim sum for lunch. I drove three of my colleagues over to the restaurant. My other colleague took two others. \n\nI decided to go against Google Maps. Sometimes, I wonder how useful it is to do a u-turn instead of turning left at the intersection. \n\nThis plaza gets busy. We got there just before noon, so we were fine. \n\nWe got a round table. There were seven of us. We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle. \n\nWe ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there! So much for pacing how much we eat. \n\nThe dim sum was delicious. Some of my favourites are the following:\n- Crab claw balls (so good, especially the meat in the claw)\n- Har gow\n- Sticky rice in fragrant leaves\n- Rice rolls (shrimp and barbeque pork)\n\nI had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish. I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish. \n\nWe split the bill. Each person ended up paying $22, which included the tip. I was good with it. My boss said that it was expensive. This restaurant accepts credit, debit, and cash. \n\nThe dim sum quality was amazing. This restaurant houses a ton of people. At one point, a tour bus full of tourists came in. I would guess that it easily seats 200 people. \n\nI&#x27;d come back here again. It&#x27;s fully licensed, which is another reason why I need to come back.  \n\n(215)&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Their dim sum and Chinese dishes are better than a lot of other Mississauga ones BUT the 2 stars is because last January (2010)  I held my engagement party here and we had worked out a \&quot;deal\&quot; because I paid cash up front and on the day of, which was one price of $1200 covers 5 tables of catered food,  \&quot;taxes\&quot; and tips, which is not bad. \n\nMy parents went to pay the day of and I was having too much fun taking pictures to go with them. The manager the day was such a cheat and liar and told my parents the price did not include the \&quot;tip&#x27; so my parents being as trusting as they are gave them an extra $200 on top of it?!?!? \n\nI also had given each of our 3-4 servers a red pocket for luck.\n\nThey also book ours with another huge, large party with a microphone so it was really hard to hear anything when speeches or announcements were being made, especially for two of my best friends and their parents sitting at the table closest to the other rooms. A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI didn&#x27;t find out til a week later when I went to ask my parents if they had change form the $1400 I handed them to pay with. SO mad and felt so cheated and my engagement night is now tainted with this memory. So since then I have never gone back EVER.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I was craving dim sum the day before so my parents took me out for dim sum today. We arrived around 10:30 am so it wasn&#x27;t busy at all. However, it took a while to flag down staff members at the beginning of our visit.\n\nMost of the food that we got were carted out but we also ordered a few items that we didn&#x27;t see being carted out. It is a bit expensive because it came out to $55 (including tax and tip) for only the three of us. Some of my faves today were the scallops, shumai, noodle roll with shrimp, and the curry squid.\n\nOverall, it was an average dim sum experience. Food was good but service was non-existent at the beginning.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The atmosphere in the dining room looks nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  It&#x27;s slightly dated, but there are glimmering chandeliers everywhere, Persian printed broadloom, and nice curtains.  \n\nHaving said that, washrooms could be nicer.  Again, this is another Chinese place where warm/hot water in the restrooms is not even an option.  Only ice cold water flows out of faucet.  And certain stalls are used as storage spaces for cleaning supplies.  I really don&#x27;t like this.  It makes me question their cleanliness.\n\nFood-wise, there seems to be quite a large selection for dim sum.  Service was also nicer than most places and the staff tried to find out what dish someone in our group wanted, but didn&#x27;t know what it was called.  Initially, they brought the wrong dish, but didn&#x27;t make a fuss when we said that that wasn&#x27;t the dish.  They also took that extra step by taking out a binder, with coloured photos, in order to try to identify the particular item.  This gets them extra points!\n\nOur table ordered so much that we were given 10% discount.\n\nWould get more *s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room.  Food is alright, I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is, but I find it just alright.&quot;,

Full bar, no alcohol on tap though. The servers are kind of rude and snappy, but the service is very fast. As for the food: IT. IS. AMAZING! The portions are huge, absolutely delicious and cooked fresh, and the prices are extremely reasonable! I ordered the Sautéed jumbo shrimp and grilled vegetables as a healthy option, and the shrimp was delicious! It was perfectly cooked, very light, very big, very yummy, and there was so much of it I struggled to finish. My boyfriend ordered the sweet &amp; sour chicken with noodles and they were both great. Definitely recommend for a fun night out to much with friends :) \n\nP.S. They serve you green tea in a little pot when you&#x27;re first seated, and orange slices and fortune cookies after your meal.&quot;,

Given, I guess you have to strategize to know what&#x27;s fresh or not. \n\nThe food was okay. Not spectacular. but very good. A great place to come for a work celebration or work lunch.  The clientel is mostly local Chinese folk, or people that work near by. \n\nThey are SO aggressive here! On many of an occasion they would put plates on our table, and say \&quot;here, you like this!\&quot; We&#x27;re like...no, thanks, full \&quot;No! you like this!\&quot; And when I say no a second time, they take it back (one of them was ever grumbling how we didn&#x27;t want vegetables!)\nIt&#x27;s like they make a commission here or something. \nI would suggest, know what you want, and don&#x27;t succumb to their ploys. \n\nThey are super busy around here, so don&#x27;t be afraid of putting up your hand and flagging someone down. \n\ni&#x27;m not sure of the price for each dish, but for 10 people, we paid about $18 PER PERSON....&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve come to Emerald for both dim sum and dinner before.  This review will be for dinner.\n\nOur group of 6 arrived around 7pm on a Friday night.  The restaurant was about half full.  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs.  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged. \n\nWe ordered one of the set menus for $88 which included:\n\n- House soup\n\n- 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions.  I don&#x27;t eat crab that often but it&#x27;s probably one of the best I&#x27;ve tasted.  Lots of meat, not too much work needed to dig it out.  The meat was very fresh and not overdone.  \n\n- Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skin\n\n- Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushrooms\n\n- Fish and deep fry tofu\n\n- Stirfry tung choi\n\nIn addition, we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chicken.\n\nFood came fast and super hot.  Portions were gigantic especially the tofu/fish and snow pea leaves dishes.  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menu.\n\nDessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet taro/tapioca soup.\n\nOverall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people.  We had 2 jumbo containers of leftovers with the bill coming to $140 before tip.&quot;,

The service was very friendly, they didn&#x27;t speak fluent English but you can communicate with them easily! The place is just OK, cleanliness is moderate but food was excellent! We ordered the lobster, sword fish fried rice, chicken curry, snow pea leaf with garlic and beef sauté everything was great! So tasty and delicious! I would recommend the fried rice and curry! The potion size is huge! It&#x27;s best if you share!&quot;,

Like they say your brain is bigger than your stomach! \n\nHowever no worries here as we pretty much always take home the left overs for our kids.&quot;,

People always complain about service ... but you should know what you&#x27;re getting into. Its a dim sum place! \n\nThe food never disappoints. I cant even name a dish that wasn&#x27;t good. The cart dim sum give its that fun experience of the excitement of seeing the cart come by. Whats in the cart?!? Its great for kids and adults. The price has gone up in the last couple of years, but honestly its expected. The food never disappoints and i will be back. \n\nRecommendations:\n- For weekends, come around 10:30am. Any later and you&#x27;ll be trapped in a crowd of chaos! \n- The manager lady always tries to sell a couple dishes that she runs around with. Don&#x27;t get them! They are usually the older items that wasn&#x27;t sold\n- Theres an automatic charge for \&quot;tea\&quot; per person, consider that when tipping \n- If there is a certain item you want and cant seem to find on the carts, just ask the people in the black vest. They can always preorder for you. \n- be ready to eat!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;(4.5 Stars)\nI love Dim Sum so I decided to give Emerald a try, and boy was I sure glad I did! I came here for breakfast a few times, and always came out happy.  I also came here for dinner a few times.  (I hope this tells you just how much I love Dim Sum LOL)\nThe crispy squid was delicious, crispy, hot, yummilicious.... and the roast duck was absolutely delicious! Will definitely come here again! :)&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Came in for lunch today, but not for dim sum. It was for my nephew&#x27;s baby moon, so a ten course was ordered.\n\nThis is not in my neck of the woods either, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other places in Mississauga.\n\nSince it WAS dim sum hour, it was really hectic. At no fault of the restaurant though. Customer service was still pretty good here.\n\nThe food was average, we had the standard banquet dishes of crab claw ball, garlic pea shoots, steamed fish, crispy chicken etc. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. \n\nWe did order a few dim sum dishes afterwards, like chicken feet and siu mai. \n\nI can&#x27;t comment on the pricing either. \n\nOverall it was alright, but like I said, I&#x27;m never in Mississauga, so I&#x27;d only be back if there was a function there.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Four out of Five stars for a traditional Chinese restaurant. The decor and ambiance is what you would expect from such a place. However it is our favorite place to go when we have a hunkering for Dim-Sum. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is good, and price is right. A la cart is also very good and there are a lot of good traditional Chinese dishes, same as you would find in China. I enjoy Emerald. Ask for TsingTao beer with your meal, and try the pork belly and  and also the lobster dishes.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Very authentic chinese food. Excellent service, clean, nice ambience.  The decoration is typical to fine chinese restaurants in China.  I have been in different parts of China several times, so I can truly know when a place is authentic.  The waiter who assisted us was very kind and trying and achieving his best to understand us and serve us good.  The food was fresh, tasty and good quality.  Everything seemed clean and ambience medium-medium/high class people.  Is the type of chinese restaurant you will enjoy if looking for authentic and fine chinese food.  Prices a bit high but the restaurant deserves it for the food/service/ambiance quality.\n\nSo far the best chinese restaurant we have found in Mississauga.  We took our leftovers home happily and definitely going back!&quot;,

Sui mai/pork dumplings which is a staple of dim sum food choices so go figure - they finally came and pretty small).\n\nAny ways, had better (in Markham) and worse (downtown toronto Chinatown) so 3 stars is average&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Went for dim sum yesterday (my first time) for lunch and it sure was a different experience. The restaurant was extremely busy but we still managed to get a table right away. \n\nThe first thing I was confused about was how it worked. I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you. Also, I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter. Even after that I wasn&#x27;t sure as most of them can&#x27;t speak English so it was hard to communicate. \n\nThe food itself wasn&#x27;t bad. It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything, just satisfied. We tried a few things (including chicken feet) which was an interesting experience. The spices on the chicken feet tasted good, but there was almost no meat on it (I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty). I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in. \n\nOverall, the experience was something new to me but the food doesn&#x27;t leave me wanting more. I was drinking water like crazy for the next 3 hours after as the meal left me extremely thirsty (MSG?) \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you really want to try traditional dim sum once.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place has hands down the worst food and service that I have experienced in a while. \nThe decor was super tacky. The carpet, chairs and the stage were all covered in a gold colour. To top it off the cloth on the chairs was very dirty. \nThe servers could not care less about cracking a smile. When asked for the dumping menu I was given a photo album with just pictures. I then had to ask for another menu that had the description of dumplings. Upon this the server got irritated. \nThe food was super gross. The crab and corn soup had a bad fishy taste. The chicken balls were 90% batter and 10% chicken. They were also fried in an old oil. The only thing that was decent was the scallop dumplings. \nPlease avoid this place at all costs. I will not be returning!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m told this restaurant has been around for numerous years and the rest of my party were regulars here. Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds, fish tank, things weren&#x27;t new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.\n\nThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular à la carte menu. My table ordered off the à la carte, probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.\n\nThe soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible, but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place, literally.\n\nOther dishes came out eventually, featuring sweet and sour pork, thousand island sauce deep fried pork, egg tofu with baby shrimp, garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce, XO sauce string beans, fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home, but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done, though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard, nothing special.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either, which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party. Personally - I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill, but for being in Mississauga it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.&quot;,

When you get right down to it, this place is basically a Chinese restaurant moonlighting as a banquet hall. Very elaborate and ornate decor (think gold seat covers), seating to fill a legit army (this place is huge - if you&#x27;re looking to seat a large group, this is a good place to start), and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts. \n\nIt isn&#x27;t the cheapest dim sum spot in the area, but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people, this is a safe bet. The food itself is pretty decent - food from the menu is a decent size, tasty, and comes out quickly. There&#x27;s good variety to the dim sum choices, lots of dishes to choose from, and the carts come by often. \n\nOverall, a decent choice. Note: they also take reservations.&quot;,

This is my go to dim sum place on the weekend in the ssaug.\n\nWho doesn&#x27;t love carts of steaming bamboo containers being pushed around you? It&#x27;s packed though. Go before 11am or after 1pm. They serve dim sum until 4pm on the weekends. Then it becomes a regular Chinese restaurant - I have totally made that mistake before, although their chicken wasn&#x27;t bad.\n\nThis places charges for tea, so make sure you want tea before you ordered it. It can get pricey and that&#x27;s how a lot of dim sum places get you!\n\nI see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do. All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you... Especially if you aren&#x27;t Asian... Also, if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins, you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests. They take their division of labour very seriously.\n\nYou should order a side of the stir fry snow peas. They don&#x27;t normally bring that out. It&#x27;s solid!\n\nMy personal favourites are the scallop dumplings (they are known for their scallop dishes), seafood dumplings, chicken feet, crab claw and fried tofu wrap...\n\nI&#x27;m probably going this weekend. Thinking about it makes me hungry.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Its been awhile since I&#x27;ve visited this restaurant and I must say that this time around, I actually enjoyed the food we ordered. Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lot.\n\nPrices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a days.\n\nDecor needs an update... if anyone cares. And also, theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive (its hard to use the term friendly because they weren&#x27;t lol) when we came in and our service was prompt.\n\nParking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full. \n\nOverall, not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go either.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Wasn&#x27;t that great. Taste of the food was blend. Not authentic chinese food. Ambiance very loud. Servers were screaming among themselves and they forget they have customers who are close to them. Been hurting our ears the whole time. \nWas weird seeing the lady server removing a fish from the tank to show a customer and kept talking with the fish still alive in her net. Since the customer didn&#x27;t want it she kept pushing it. Then finally drop the fish back in the tank&quot;,

Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Went to this restaurant on Saturday as I had a craving for a Japanese ramen. It was packed for Saturday dinner. We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll, donkotsu ramen and katsu jyu(pork cutlet with egg). \n\nAfter soft shell crab roll was served first, we waited for 30minutes for other dishes. They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend. The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waiting.\n\nThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but salty.(or was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accident?!)I liked the noodle though. Katsu jyu was katsu-don in a bento box style. Katsu was okay, not that crispy enough. I maybe expected too much(authentic japanese ramen and donkotsu) as I heard the owner was Japanese. They can do better. \nIt leaves a lot to be desired. 3stars for the food and 2stars for the service.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place will always have a place in my stoma....errr...heart.  I have been coming here since high school, and I had graduated in &#x27;05 (woot!).  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.\n\nI like Musashi as it&#x27;s small and intimate in there.  They have booths, tables, a small bar, but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you&#x27;d have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor, but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!\n\nI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch, make sure to look towards your right and you&#x27;ll see A, B, C lunch options.  Those options aren&#x27;t on the menu and change daily.  \n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life, this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can&#x27;t get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart&#x27;s delight!\n\nThe staff here is really nice and you&#x27;ll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.  Come check them out!  I promise you&#x27;ll enjoy their food!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I&#x27;ve been to. Not only that, but the prices aren&#x27;t too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).\n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special. It&#x27;s a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that&#x27;s your thing). Personally, I&#x27;d rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn&#x27;t mind at all.\n\nAll-in-all, I think I&#x27;ll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that&#x27;s a bit tough to find in Charlotte.\n\nThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!&quot;,

Service was excellent, got seated immediately and food came out really quickly faster than Sonics. Limited on choices for lunch but all was excellent. Soft rice to crispy katsu equals great quality. Will be coming back again to try others on the menu! Recommend the Katsu-Don and Katsu Curry.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Waiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before. It was rather salty instead.  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case, I&#x27;m not giving Musashi up yet since it&#x27;s close to home cooking. \n\n03-03-17 (A Friday Dinner)\nDisappointed. It was packed tonight. Had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Then, had to wait 45-50 for our food. But, the waiting wasn&#x27;t the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG. \n\nThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And, the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi, not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco. \n\nTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl, NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm, I guess I&#x27;m ole fashion n lived in Japan too long. \n\nI also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What&#x27;s with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But, I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.\n\nWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG, lots n lots. \n\nThe tempura shrimp was perfect, not doughy or undercooked. \n\nStill, since it&#x27;s near, I&#x27;m not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Tonkatsu Ramen!!!\nITADAKIMAS!!\n\nThis place is authentic. \nYou&#x27;ll find several decent types of sake and small plates here, from Shisamo to hamachi kama.\nif you have not had either, you should try it. Their agedashi tofu is also awesome.\n\nThey have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen. Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu is good, but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorful.\n\nI had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and I&#x27;m happy to say it was a great experience!  Everyone in there seemed like regulars (several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night), and some seemed to have \&quot;their table.\&quot;  Just like another reviewer said, I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity.  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic (and awesome).\n\nThe service was a little slow and disorganized, so that&#x27;s the only reason I can&#x27;t give Musashi 5 stars.  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic.  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer.  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husband&#x27;s sushi.  Would&#x27;ve been nice to eat together but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.  Like I said, a little disorganized but otherwise very good.  \n\nWe will definitely go back to Musashi - great food, authentic experience and well priced.&quot;,

This place is like someone&#x27;s grandma made food for you it&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s not super fancy greatness of the food is mostly in how it&#x27;s done and what&#x27;s in it. It is  well prepared yummy and delicious.  Its not going to break my bank because it&#x27;s fancy.  It&#x27;s simple I have hit every ramen place in town and this is the place I go to 90%of the time.&quot;,

I could have eaten just those for dinner!\n\nHubby had the Sushi Deluxe plate, and enjoyed the chef&#x27;s selections. I ordered the Chirashi, and it was great.\n\nI have to mention their salmon. It was fresh, buttery, and utterly delightful. (I&#x27;m craving it now that I&#x27;m typing this!)\n\nTheir service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant is small but efficient.\n\nWe have found our new favorite sushi in Charlotte, and will be at Muashi Japanese Restaurant often.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m a fan of their food - service is a different story. I have been here on several occasions, and there&#x27;s always a stone cold looking older Japanese lady who never cracks a smile. Honestly I&#x27;m more scared of her than anything else. The other ladies are nicer, but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier (ex. asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer). Having a large party in that tatami room is nice, but it is not the best idea during Friday &amp; Saturday nights peak time... let&#x27;s just say it can be very chaotic.\n\nWith that being said, I love their food. It&#x27;s my friend&#x27;s favorite place for ramen and Japanese homecooking. They have some sushi but not a big selection. Personally I prefer nigiri and sashimi.\n\nThey have a Japanese menu - I found out from my parents&#x27; Chinese friends. Again communicating with the waitstaff is difficult but it&#x27;s worth the work to order something different.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude. Especially the older cock-eyed lady. We&#x27;ve waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time. When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger table/tatami styled table because we had a party of 7. Her response was \&quot;uh no. \&quot; I didn&#x27;t understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went, after waiting an hour, one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn&#x27;t be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance, a hostess, and better management. They didn&#x27;t give us enough menus or silverware and didn&#x27;t ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky, not sure why I guess they don&#x27;t clean the floors. As for the food, I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go, try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu. I tried to give them a second chance but I&#x27;ve never felt this disrespected before. Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future. Not happy at all. Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his. I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didn&#x27;t provide me with one. How disappointing.&quot;,

Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy service.\n\nWe came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The place is pretty small so its not like they couldn&#x27;t see us. The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waiting.\nAfter we sat down, we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap. \n\nWe ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables. The tamago was quite good. \n\nI got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it. A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying $9 for it. It had no taste, no spices, not even any soy sauce in it. It was literally broth and noodles. I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatable.\n\nOh and the service wasn&#x27;t bad for all customers - these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them. Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them. They never had to ask for anything, the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes. \n\nThe service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty good.&quot;,

Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd. location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved to Colony Road location.  \n\nSushi here are very fresh and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese. The service is typical of small family run restaurant.  They tend to get overwhelm when it is too busy.  \n\nMango Mochi is our children favorite dessert.

At 12 pm, the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. There were a few booths, two small 2-top tables, a few larger tables pushed together and a separate, traditional dining area for larger parties.\n\nThey had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register. I ordered the lunch special A - rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen. The beau ordered the miso ramen. Overall, I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his. It really wasn&#x27;t anything to rave about though. Pretty standard. Definitely not the best ramen I&#x27;ve had, but hey... It was Charlotte good. \n\nA few things I found annoying... The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best. I won&#x27;t be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramen.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place has the unfortunate distinction of serving up the worst toro I&#x27;ve ever had--instead of butter, I got coal.  That aside, the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets.  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal. You will always have two options to choose from--and while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B, I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever.  My parents and sister love the mackerel here, if that&#x27;s your thing; I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers.  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer, Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba. \n\nI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly.  Like Kabernet Sabigny-kind of weird.  That was sort of endearing.\n\nOf course, it&#x27;s plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have, which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitality.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Musashi is by far- the best Japanese Restaurant! \n\nMy choices are from the appetizer are: \n\nShrimp Shumai (Steamed shrimp dumplings) and Shrimp Tempura (Lightly battered fried shrimp &amp; vegetable) - yes, I order these two items for my appetizer every time we come.  I don&#x27;t care, it was an amazing flavor, real Japanese style Shumai and Tempura! it is a perfection. \n\nThen, I would then order my favorite soup : \n\nTonkotsu (Pork bone base)  Japanese egg noodle w/ roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot &amp; green onions. Can&#x27;t complete the heavenly dinner without my favorite soup.\n\n\nand for the Main: \n\nThe bento box, is the best option. You could choose from chicken, beef or pork or salmon. \n\nI always choose either Chicken or Beef! Teriyaki- but the best thing about BENTO BOX is that it has everything in it- pretty much! maybe pricey but it is worth the $$$ paid for because it was damn excellent!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My favorite authentic Japanese food in town! It&#x27;s a small family owned restaurant. Love their lunch specials. They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price. Every dish from agedashi tofu, tonkasu-don, ramen, nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply delicious!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen.  They don&#x27;t answer their phone any time of day and don&#x27;t return calls so it&#x27;s nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.  \n\nBut it&#x27;s a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That&#x27;s probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad, if expensive, sake selection.  \n\nI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier.  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time, so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway.  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or more.&quot;,

Dry pork instead of pork belly. Asked if they could make just a plate of noodles for our 3 year old and she said no.  We don&#x27;t have noodles.  Well what is in your ramen?  Services was just plain rude.&quot;,

And some appetizers.\n\nSushi rolls the right way, katsu tastes like authentic and agedashi was good too.\n\nGyoza was excellent, something I haven&#x27;t had the best for long time.  You can tell they are home made.\n\nCurry, I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market, but nonetheless it tastes good.  But it&#x27;s pricey for its serving.\n\nRamen is still not the best I had.  They use lean pork.  The broth is just ok.  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed.  I m a big fan of ramen, and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta.  Need to try the yume bistro next.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Came back for Ramen and so very glad I did!! This place had some absolutely delicious ramen that was flavored and cooked to perfection. I am not a ramen expert but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had in Charlotte. \n\nAgain their other food is good and authentic and while I originally said I wasn&#x27;t blown away I feel like it might be a slight injustice. The food at Musashi&#x27;s is made to be good. It&#x27;s kind of like when your mom or grandmother cooks. You know you love it and it tastes amazing to you but it&#x27;s not something you see in a fancier establishment so you don&#x27;t feel impressed. However it is exactly that good and tastes great and that&#x27;s what you get from Musashi&#x27;s!&quot;,

And it&#x27;s really good too!  I had some of the best Tonkatsu ever and my mom is Japanese.  My husband had the Chicken Katsu which was breast and is always a plus.  He said it was so tender and crispy.  I also had the Ika Karaage which was fried crispy yet was not tough at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to go back and try something else!  \n\nService was fast for a small place.  They all work together as a team and it shows.&quot;,

We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it&#x27;s a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!&quot;,

It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn&#x27;t seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was. Well, that is true. It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan. The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it, it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices, I would be back. However, with that dish costing $15+, I&#x27;d rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;So this place comes highly recommended!! It is behind my favorite Thai/Vietnamese place (Viet-Thai) and once night we thought we&#x27;d check it out.\n\nWe had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken. Everything was good, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away. I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time, but it has a sesame dressing. I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese!! That speaks volumes...  FYI he loved the place but didn&#x27;t think his chicken was the best. We both agreed we&#x27;d be back to try the Ramen and Udon!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;4 years later (since my initial review) and nothing has changed! I love love love Musashi. I highly recommend coming here for lunch, which for me, means my Saturday lunches are usually here. They usually do 3 \&quot;specialty\&quot; lunch boxes: Box A, B and C. A is usually a unique, homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little of both and other times it&#x27;s a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious. Other recommendations are: katsu-don (katsu with egg and onions over rice), grilled mackerel, chicken katsu and agedashi tofu.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;First off, we WILL return.  This place is pretty solid on humble authentic atmosphere and recipe/presentation.  It is obviously a favorite of the Japanese-American population of Charlotte!\n\nAfter many good Yelpers guided us to this spot, we decided finally to give it a try.  A busy spot and a small restaurant.  It did not appear that they took reservations; I&#x27;m not sure.  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six.  Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.\n\nWe plan to try more sushi varieties; it&#x27;s right in line with prices from other places.  It&#x27;s very fresh, straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn&#x27;t wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfied.\n\nThe service staff is so very nice and cheerful.  If you know Japanese (my husband does) they love to make conversation.&quot;,

Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the ramen there. It was not bad, but not what I was looking for. I also ordered a spicy tuna roll. The roll was overpowered by mayo and was not for me. The service however was good and the staff was friendly. Just to many other better sushi places around town.&quot;,

We came back at 6:35pm.\n\nPlace - The establishment is small, but gosh it was packed on a Friday night at 6:45pm. One thing I have learned is to make reservations! It looked like almost more than half of the tables had \&quot;Reserved\&quot; signs.  There were people behind us waiting for a table.. some left.\n\nFood -\n- Tonkotsu Ramen: I was craving for some ramen, and the ramen I had ordered was alright. I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston.  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there, but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients. Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte. \n- Tonkatsu Bento Box: My friend&#x27;s husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box. \n- Katsu Chicken Entree: My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright.  \n- Salad: The salad ginger peanut dressing was good.\n- Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just shrimp tempura and the roll.. no.. other veggies - what?!\n\nService - They are good about getting to you, when you ask for their service..  When they are busy, it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you.\n\nPrice - Was alright, not too shabby, and reasonable at best. \n\nSo bottom line, I like the food... but I am in no dire need to come back. I would be happy to have their food at the Japanese Festival though.   I felt bad for the people who waited around the door for the next available seat/table.  My friends and I quickly paid for our dinner after we were done so they could be seated.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Very authentic for the area.   However, I wouldnt exactly call this \&quot;100% authentic\&quot;.   It is definitely the most authentic we&#x27;ve had in NC.   There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone.  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it.   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen, and I wanted chicken katsu curry, but the chicken katsu is $8, apparently it&#x27;s five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai, but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on, and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good, firm, stretchy, chewy, delicious.   Very good flavor in the broth.  \n\nWe will be back to give this place another shot, they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed.  Also, we wont order the shumai again, it just didn&#x27;t seem right to us.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I figure I&#x27;d add to this review too, my sister (michelle r. here on Yelp) already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic!  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials.  If not the special, yes, the katsudon is delicious (served w/ rice and onions and an egg on top!).  So are their bento boxes, I&#x27;ll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes, their sushi is also really good.  My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a little small and it can get too crowded and busy, when that happens I&#x27;ll go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the corner...&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Waiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before. It was rather salty instead.  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case, I&#x27;m not giving Musashi up yet since it&#x27;s close to home cooking.\n\nMmm at least the ika on the nigiri is thick and the uni on the nigiri is two pieces on one nigiri! And! I hv lotsa of tuna on my tekkadon! Only thing tho the Saba on the nigiri was salty. Never had a salty Saba before. \n\nThird cup of green tea! Yummm&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;After a just okay visit to Yama last week, the fella convinced me to try \&quot;the best sushi in Charlotte\&quot; at Musashi.  I&#x27;m not a sushi fan, but I can eat teriyaki chicken and veggies anywhere.  He said he hadn&#x27;t been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered.  They were.  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good, but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi.  He said it was a smidgen chewy, but it&#x27;s octopus.  The teriyaki chicken was good, but it came with soup, salad and egg salad... no grilled veggies like I&#x27;m used to.  It was tasty though.  \n\nOur young waiter was super nice and accommodating (this Asian food nerd needed a fork), and he even bowed to say thank you when we left.  I would&#x27;ve never tried this place without the fella&#x27;s suggestion since it&#x27;s in a strip mall and the sign wasn&#x27;t even lit when we got there, but it was very warm, inviting and unassuming with great food.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte. I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don&#x27;t eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Musashi holds a special place in my heart and I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t blown up their yelp page with my review! This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I&#x27;ve been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you&#x27;re more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you&#x27;ve never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We&#x27;ve also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we&#x27;re some adventurous eaters!\n\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese&#x27;s traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you&#x27;re not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you&#x27;re in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n\nBefore I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I&#x27;m glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This review is a long time a comin but here it is either way. In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte, all alone on Yom Kippur, which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day, thats right an entire day. Basically, the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner, which makes it even more excruciating. By 8pm (1.5 hours past sun down) I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier, she had told me of a secret japanese menu, and fresh fish.\n\nWell I can tell you this place has BOTH! And the best part, is the head chef there and owner, is quite japanese, and began his career in my home city&#x27;s (Toronto) first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s. Suffice to say, I was pretty sold after talking to this guy \n\nThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot (not sure what the name of that is),  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but I&#x27;ve been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item. \n\nProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru, yet to try new zealand which i also heard was great.&quot;,

Everything was excellent - it looks to be a family-owned business as well, and it shows with the excellent and courteous service (of course, the place is usually busy, so don&#x27;t come here expecting fast food, but our order arrived within reasonable time). Do check this place out!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve only been here once, but this place impressed me. The service was a bit slow, but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty. Well, the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup, but the katsu don served over rice was....I&#x27;ve never had better katsu don. I would eat it again. Most sushi restaurants I&#x27;ve gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans, but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner. Definitely recommend it.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Musashi was an overall great experience. The restaurant is quaint,warm, and cozy. I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli, fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious. It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing. The chicken teriyaki was served with soup,salad, rice and noodles. The most outstanding part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend it!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Not exactly sure how this restaurant got so many 5* reviews. Without any other restaurants in the area that serve anything \&quot;japanese\&quot; besides sushi, It&#x27;s great that they serve ramen and tonkatsu, but they were only fair. Unfortunately the service suffered too, as they are understaffed. \n\nThis place has potential but I will probably not be coming back for a while.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Mixed review. I was expecting more, but left a bit disappointed. First of all, the directions from Google maps is a bit off...it takes you through an apartment complex to a dead end. It&#x27;s located in a shopping center (with Food Lion). \n\nThe atmosphere is small with humble interior design. There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions. \n\nThe greeting was all smiles. The service wasn&#x27;t fast, but not too slow either. Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendly.\n\nThe sushi list was limited, but priced well. The spicy tuna roll was very good. Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for $12. Very disappointing. The restaurant was fairly busy, so I&#x27;m sure they have better dishes. I&#x27;ll have to go back and try some of the noodle items.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I would say this place was just okay for me. Nothing to amazing, but the server was nice. My husband did not like his sushi very much but I liked my vegetable tempura. Our son did not eat most of his bento box and did not like his steak very much either.  Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was just not as good a quality as they are used to, either way I don&#x27;t think we will be back.&quot;,

I just came back from my first visit for lunch and clearly they know what their doing when it comes to noodles and soups. I ordered their pork-based ramen soup with a squid salad. Both easily compared to some of the best I used to enjoy back in Philadelphia&#x27;s Asian district. This is absolutely my Go-To place in Charlotte for noodles. And I can&#x27;t wait until I get to visit this place again.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Waiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before. It was rather salty instead.  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case, I&#x27;m not giving Musashi up yet since it&#x27;s close to home cooking. \n\n03-03-17 (A Friday Dinner)\nDisappointed. It was packed tonight. Had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Then, had to wait 45-50 for our food. But, the waiting wasn&#x27;t the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG. \n\nThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And, the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi, not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco. \n\nTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl, NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm, I guess I&#x27;m ole fashion n lived in Japan too long. \n\nI also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What&#x27;s with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But, I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.\n\nWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG, lots n lots. \n\nThe tempura shrimp was perfect, not doughy or undercooked. \n\nStill, since it&#x27;s near, I&#x27;m not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time. \n\n06/24/17 Party of four n I was the one to suggest Musashi tonight BUT my tekka don came after everyone else finished their dinner. Granted it&#x27;s crowded tonite got but still. Even the newly arrived ppl sitting next to us got their dinner b4 me&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don&#x27;t be thrown off by it&#x27;s location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San&#x27;s) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You&#x27;ll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it&#x27;s less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn&#x27;t good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it&#x27;s pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don&#x27;t think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can&#x27;t get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you&#x27;re accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn&#x27;t going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don&#x27;t need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte. My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.\n\nWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.\n\nThe lady wasn&#x27;t so friendly but I don&#x27;t mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don&#x27;t remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn&#x27;t happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom&#x27;s udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll comeback when I&#x27;m in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi. I just want to say that just because it&#x27;s owned by Japanese don&#x27;t automatically assume that it&#x27;ll be good.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!\n\nTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?\n\nThe service is always perfect. I love the staff there. They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right. To the people saying the \&quot;service is slow\&quot;, The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It&#x27;s Japanese!\n\nAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it&#x27;s AUTHENTIC!\n\n優秀食品！&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Best sushi in town. Apparently they are the most authentic japanese restaurant in Charlotte having hired one of the best sushi chefs. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true, but the sushi is amazing. If you go during lunch they have a special for $8.50 and is more than enough food to eat. \n\nMy only complaint is that they don&#x27;t have fountain sodas - so if you order, you&#x27;re getting a can. But this doesn&#x27;t stop me from giving this place 5 stars b/c of the food is that good.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I have always had a really good experience here.  It is never too crowded and the service is always excellent.  They are open on Mondays when most places with ramen aren&#x27;t.  The service is quick and friendly.\n\nI love the ramen.  It&#x27;s always delicious.  It is very consistent.  I always get the steamed dumplings as well and love them too.  The broth for the ramen is so flavorful, it&#x27;s like you just can&#x27;t get enough.  \n\nParking is easy with a large shared lot.  The restaurant inside is clean, cozy, and comfortable.  Always very happy with my visits here.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Super authentic casual Japanese restaurant.  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \n\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that&#x27;s unsurprising.\n\nMusashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here&#x27;s a rundown on what I had:\n\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything&#x27;s very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\n- Anago - delicious, buttery\n- ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch\n- surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\n- saba - marinated and tasty\n- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \n\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn&#x27;t have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don&#x27;t do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish&quot;,

Justin is AWESOME. \n\nI called 7 plumbers that afternoon ALL were extremely busy, all were names with \&quot;A\&quot; rating from Angie&#x27;s List incidentally. Queen City Responded quickly and I asked for Justin the owner. \n\nI was referred to Queen City By Tim from Fergusen Plumbing - Tim at Fergusen said to ask for Justin. Justin like all other plumbers was busy and he did not call me back till late that afternoon. By then I had received quotes from other plumbers who could come over the next day; many quotes where from the high of $310 - to $194 just to diagnose my plumbing problem. \n\nJustin was the least expensive to evaluate by far, so I called him back and he responded rather quickly in his amazing purple truck. Very good guy with an amazing sense of humor.\n\nJustin diagnosed my problem in less than five minutes. And he gave me a referral as well and let me borrow his extension cord too. Good experience. I would hire him or refer him.\n\nIt turns out it was an electrical problem, the pump worked fine.\n\nI made balloon art for 2 of his boys (he has FIVE) in appreciation.

It was a wonderful experience - the people that work there are great and great at what they do!  I highly recommend it!  Now I can get everything done all at the same salon, my nails done by George, pedicures/manicures, etc done by Erin (RiverRock Esthetics), and my hair by Liz!\n\nUnfortunately Erin (RiverRockEsthetics) is no longer there :( not sure who if anyone has taken her place as of yet.&quot;,

You get beautiful gel nails and you are entertained by George making it an all around great experience!  They also have a full hair salon as well as RiverRock Esthetics for all your beauty needs!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Once upon a time, I was 16 and decided to get a perm.  Then I decided to straighten that shit out.  I was brave back then.  I just opened the phone book, closed my eyes and took a shot in the dark.  \n\nI met a wonderful young stylist named Stephanie Fletcher and I have followed her around faithfully since.  I lived in LA for two years and flew back to AZ to see Stephanie.  Now, I live in Scottsdale and drive to Glendale to see Stephanie.  The day she retires, I will slit my own wrists.  That was a little dramatic, but that is how much I love her.  She has never done me wrong.  I trust her completely.  If she told me to get a buzz cut, I would do it.  \n\nIf you&#x27;re a blonde and don&#x27;t want to look like a cheap whore, go to Stephanie.  No offense to cheap looking blondes, the world needs you too. \n\nI guess this review is more for Stephanie than Vita Bella, but  Vita Bella is definitely benefiting from my love of Stephanie!  They also sell Enjoy products, which I actually enjoy a lot and can&#x27;t find anywhere else.  \n\nNow, she only works three days a week.  So, I will kill you if you take all of her time away from me. \n\nBy the way, she straightened out my perm without ruining my hair.  I think every girl needs to make the mistake of getting a perm in their lifetime.  It&#x27;s a rite of passage.&quot;,

She does a great job with hair color, style, and offers Brazilian Blowouts. \n\nI&#x27;ve followed her 4 times in over a decade and I&#x27;m living on the East Coast and still making it a priority to see her, well, that should be testament enough. \n\nThe salon itself has a very boutique feel. Well decorated and stocked with merchandise so you can be prepared to take on your &#x27;do when you get home. The location is great on the backside of the shopping center on the Northwest corner of 59th &amp; Union Hills. \n\nDo yourself a favor and book your next appointment here.&quot;,

Now over twenty years later Calgary&#x27;s first ISP still provides top notch service with accessible internet at an accessible rate.\n\nWhen I signed up for a year of service I had to visit their office to pick up the free modem rental. I was delighted when the receptionist called for someone to bring me the paperwork and was met with a polite representative that shook my hand.\n\nFollowup phone calls have been equally pleasant and personable. Unlike call center drones the staff at Nucleus have a real relationship with their customers and treat them better than billing numbers. I really appreciate this seldom seen type of service in such a competitively priced market!\n\nThe internet service in itself has been fast and ultra reliable. Their basic service is less expensive than Telus and Shaw!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My first email and website hosting service was with Nucleus in 1999, and though happy with them, I migrated in 2000 when my employer provided incentives for signing with Shaw and broadband. However, my second employer still utilizes Nucleus as a web hosting service. The service has been poor - customer service is slow to respond, interface has not kept up with the times (compare to larger sites like GoDaddy or HostPapa) and they show no inclination to meet specific needs - for example, the hundreds (thousands?) of webmasters who were abandoned mercilessly by MicroSoft when FrontPage was abandoned. The larger services still support FrontPage Server Extensions because they know that many of the amateur webmasters can&#x27;t devote time and resources to upgrading software (and, more importantly, taking the time to learn new software, and then devoting hundreds or thousands of hours to upgrade pages to new standards). Nucleus has not been accommodating to those trapped in this circle, while other services have been very understanding. As much as I like supporting local, small businesses, sorry Nucleus, you have to put your customers&#x27; needs first.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is one of the most exquisite Taco Belles in all of the Phoenix Valley. All I can say is WOW!!! So. Let me start with the décor. Classic movie posters really put me in the mood for some authentic Mexican food. Now, let tell you that not all Taco Bells are created equal. This one is truly a cut above the rest. It&#x27;s finger lickin good. Definitely RECOMMEND&quot;,

However I have to leave a review because every time I come here there&#x27;s the same girl working the drive thru. She&#x27;s just so nice and does a great job at getting all the orders done. Honestly, sometimes it seems like she&#x27;s on her own! Idk if she enjoys her job but her personality just shines through! She&#x27;s just so genuinely kind! I tried to see what her name was but didn&#x27;t catch it.&quot;,

It seems taco bell through out my life goes through cycles of crapness to craptastic!  \n\nSo like 20 years ago, it was like you ordered taco bell you would get grease tacos with some lettuce and something that resembled cheese. \n\nThen like 10 years ago it was like \&quot;Yo Quiro Taco Bell\&quot; with that little annoying fucking Chihuahua which was OK Taco Bell was kind of hip and tasted craptastic, remember according to the movie Demolition Man with Sly all restaurants will eventually turn into Taco Bells...this thankfully will never happen. \n\nAnd once again Taco Bell is now crapness food that is similar  to Filberto&#x27;s only good if you are somewhat drunk and nothing else is open. I told myself I would never go here again after gas prices got up to around 4 bucks and I went in to order two chicken soft taco supremes, and it was like 6 bucks for just the two of them, and I was like are you fn kidding me? They said they had to raise their prices due to the rising cost of fuel.\n\nThis is right about the time they came out with their value menu of you can get a tortilla filled with baby poop for 79 cents campaign, I recently made the mistake of hitting the drive thru one hungry drunk night and  remembered why I vowed never to go there again.\n\nMy check was like 10 bucks for what I think were 4 soft tacos and a large drink, they could have been something someone puked into a tortilla with some lettuce and some bile for that matter, I was sick for two days...literally.\n\n I will never go to this location again, except maybe to protest the poisoning of the people by a huge corporation...eat here at your own risk it could be your last meal.&quot;,

It&#x27;s fast food, hello! It&#x27;s not gonna be awesome. I mean you are paying less than a buck for some of the stuff on the menu. I doubt anyone goes here unless they are broke, in a hurry or drunk. \n\nI have to give this location props tho, they are super nice and friendly. Always a \&quot;Hello, welcome, how is your day going?\&quot; when I pull up to the drive through. Big smiles when I get to the window. Then the topper, \&quot;Have a great day, come back and see us soon!\&quot; I mean seriously, they are great! I am usually there once a week, usually after a long day and they always seem to perk me up. \n\nAfter the less than two words spoken and sour faces I get at Wendy&#x27;s this place is awesome. Seriously, go compare the two places and tell me I am not spot on. \n\nHappy Belling! :-)&quot;,

It was bland so I added the eldiablo  sauce.  Place appeared to be clean&quot;,

A rowdy but respectful full crowd, lots of other beers on tap, and plenty of tv&#x27;s.  There were even some games in the back such as shuffleboard and darts.\n\nI ended up meeting a lot of cool people that night just sitting on the front patio.  I even met a few employees and they were all super nice and helpful.  Shae and T.C. especially.  I guess they were off, but still willing to show me around and such.\n\nAll in a great bar that apparently is a barber shop as well.  I&#x27;ll be back if in the area.  Supposedly they even offer shuttles there and back to other location.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The three star rating is quite fair as service is very sweet and warm, and cupcakes are okay/good. Having gone to a few famed cupcake establishments at the prime of the great cupcake craze, if i must be honest, I&#x27;ll have to say that baby cake&#x27;s selection today was rather limited and uninspired. Where were the pretty little cupcakes pictured in previous yelp posts? Where&#x27;s the whimsy? I picked out a red velvet today which was moist and good, not bad, but not all that special in cake or icing. For two dollars a pop, the icing could have used a bit more effort in piping. Looking forward to give them another try if other reviews show that this was just a weird day.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;So where do I start, three years ago when I graduated from Highschool I had a big graduation party. I remember I really wanted a big three tiered cake, because I just love cake ! So my friends and I went around to different places and tried their cupcakes to see which one would taste the best for the right pricing. So we picked this place. What a God awful mistake that was. I said I wanted edible bones and edible pictures of x-rays on the cake since I was going to school for radiography. It was a total mess, one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. We paid over 150$ to have literally pieces of paper that were printed off the computer be put onto my cake ! And the fondant bones looked like a third grader molded them. It was absolutely heart breaking. Especially considering how well the girl made it seem like she understood. I have voices my complaints and told them exactly what this cake came out to be and they never even said sorry. I like supporting local businesses but this place is a sham. Worst experience ever. Don&#x27;t go here unless you want to be super disappointed. I wish I had a picture to show you how awful it was.&quot;,

Today, being Valentine&#x27;s Day, I wanted to get my wife a small flavorful gift is not the ordinary type gift. So since I was in and around the area of Downtown Willoughby, Baby Cakes came immediately to mind.\n\nAs I parked, I saw a few people already walking out with boxes of cupcakes! (They opened at 11 and I was there at 11:30!) I&#x27;m wondering, \&quot;Late again John?\&quot;  Well, fortunately I was not. I exactly what I had in mind. Red Velvet Cupcakes, my wife&#x27;s \&quot;to die for\&quot; treat. AND a deep chocolate cupcake, w/chocolate icing, topped with a chocolate dipped strawberry! Was thinking about getting one for lunch, but thought better of it.\n\nMade my selections; had them perfectly boxed; and completed step one of this Valentine&#x27;s Day journey!  \n\nLooking for that unique bakery treat? Be sure to check out Baby Cakes! IMO you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&quot;,

Their cakes taste great and they have a bazillion flavors you can order from but I will never understand why they use basic whipped cream frosting - it really takes away from the taste and presentation of their cakes/cupcakes.  When we ordered ahead we always ask for buttercream (which is an up charge of 0.50 or $1 depending on cupcakes - and PER cupcake) but honestly without the tastier icing I would not look forward to the cupcake without it. \n\nThe baby shower we had there for my work peeps was great - remember ordered ahead for the buttercream - but only one flavor had been given the requested icing...the other was whipped cream - that one we had a bunch of left overs on - the blue champagne ZERO leftovers...icing speaks volumes!  for me the taste of a cake of cup is all about the icing - it starts and finishes your taste experience.&quot;,

We had driven by a couple of times, and had it pointed out during the \&quot;Haunted Vegas\&quot; tour a couple years ago.\n\nPutting it simply; the food was incredible!  Being from NY, I am an Italian food snob, and this was some of the best I have ever had.  I had the veal scallopini, my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven!  Then, we had the canolis for dessert!!!\n\nThe service was fantastic as well.  The place was pretty busy, but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegas.&quot;,

Mr. Liberace himself designed the interior of his restaurant and they have not changed it since his passing (no this is not a bad thing).

Recommendations: chicken parm (not veal for some reason,) meatballs, gnocchi.  Also, they have a private dining room in which I&#x27;ve had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff -- and definitely gets people to remember you.&quot;,

Right. I guess. In any case, the food was just okay, but the portions were pretty ginormous, and the price was right. The joint is off strip, which was a nice change, becuase its relatively peaceful there and the diners all seemed to be locals, except us. And trust, we did stand out. The ambiance is fun with differently themed and decorated rooms depending on your occasion and the bar there is dark as any other in Sin City, but slightly divier. Service was good, albeit a little slow, and all in all the meal was a success. A little wine never hurt anyone.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is actually a 3.5 star review and I&#x27;m giving Carluccio&#x27;s a bonus by rounding to 4. \n\nEmbarrassing that having lived in Vegas, I had no idea Carluccio&#x27;s existed. Some friends from Phoenix came down and wanted to meet at Carluccio&#x27;s for a group dinner. When I arrived at the parking lot, I was in awe. This place was ostentatious and gorgeous....just the way I like it. I felt like I was in on an old Vegas secret and someone was going to hand me a briefcase full of cash for me to do something illegal with. Carluccio&#x27;s is right next to the Liberace museum (something I need to go see) and apparently Liberace designed the interior. The interior was gold all over, hanging lights, dark lighting, dark carpets....I loved it. This is a great place to have a small dinner/family gathering. \n\nNow for the food/service. Service was average. My water glass was always full, the waiter took our order fast and the service was pleasant. Unfortunately, the waiter we had made me nervous. I asked if the Caesar salad was vegetarian and he said yes. Then I confirmed if it had anchovies (as many authentic Ceasars do) and he said \&quot;Oh yeah...it does.\&quot; But he was quick to tell me the other dressings that would suit me. The food also took forever to come out. I ordered a mixed green salad with thousand island (side salad) and an eggplant parmigiana. The mixed green came with about a gallon of thousand island on it rendering it inedible. I like my dressing but I also like to see my salad. Perhaps I should have ordered dressing on the side but I did not expect that much. The eggplant parmigiana (served with spaghetti with marinara) was very good. Fried to the right extent and with a gorgeous piece of melted mozzarella on top and drowned in tasty marinara, this was comfort food that hit all the right stops. \n\nEveryone else on the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The portion sizes were huge. I mean, I could have eaten my parmigiana for about 4 meals. No exaggeration here. I later realized that they do have half orders for some of the menu. So ask about that if you&#x27;re a light eater. The meal was also priced very very reasonably. My parmigiana was 12.99 and my husband&#x27;s spaghetti with marinara was 8.99. \n\nThe dinner also came with a magician who entertained us for a little bit. The guy was pretty good at what he did (card tricks, disappearing money that appears somewhere incredible later) and added to a fun night. \n\nHighly recommend this place for a unique group event/dinner. I&#x27;m definitely coming when my girlfriends make a trip here. I know they&#x27;d appreciate the decor (over-the-top and dark). I&#x27;d like to mention here that some girls at the group ordered cocktails that were apparently awful. The waiter did take the cocktails back. Maybe you might want to stick to wine with your meal.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I guess I need someone to tell me just what is good here food-wise (perhaps next time I should check out the Yelp reviews first). But the ambiance is totally awesome. So it evens out to 3 stars.\n\nI finally got around to eating here last weekend as part of my date night. We hadn&#x27;t read anything about it and, thus, had no idea what to expect. As soon as we walked in, we were in love. This place perfectly represents that image of \&quot;old Vegas\&quot; I have in my head. It was outlandish while also warm and welcoming. I could just picture Liberace eating here. I could also imagine the Rat Pack, mobsters, etc. eating here as it just seemed so fitting of all of them.\n\nWe started off our dining experience with the calamari. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t even edible. We had little doubt that it came straight out of a box from the frozen food aisle. 1 star. For entrees, I opted for the cavatelli (it had an icon indicating it as one of their signature dishes) and my husband had the gnocchi. The menu described the cavatelli as \&quot;sauteed\&quot; and with meat sauce. What I was served was neither sauteed nor meat sauce. I almost asked if I was served the wrong thing, but since our server was the wife of the owner, I felt bad saying anything. The pasta was too mushy, the sauce wasn&#x27;t very good at all, and I barely tasted any cheese. My date declared it inedible. I nibbled at it a bit, but refused a take home box. 1 star. My date&#x27;s gnocchi was ok, but also not cooked properly. 2 stars. And 1 star too for the wine list.\n\nAt the end of our meal, our server explained the history of the restaurant and gave us the lay of the land so to speak. It was great to walk around and see all the different rooms (love the bar area!) and all of the pictures (especially the ghost pictures). The place itself is most definitely 5 stars. And that fact alone will bring us back here and have us recommending it to visitors.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I have driven by  Carluccio&#x27;s many times over the past 20 yrs and always wanted to try it but never got around to it. It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like. Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccio&#x27;s, he said it was very good. Works for me. Really cool decor, very nice and attentive staff. I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly. I think the crutons may have been homemade. Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great. The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants. Had to take half home and eat the next day. When you walk into the door, the smell of garlic hits you, which is a good sign! I thought it was priced right, $9 and up. I will be back!&quot;,

It was really good Italian food, and pretty cheap compared to Sergio&#x27;s Italian Gardens a few doors down. And I guess the whole Liberace museum is gone too, the last of Liberace Plaza.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Can&#x27;t say much more than what everyone else has already said - as far as old school Vegas Italian food places go, this is my favorite spot in town.  How can you go wrong with good, solid food and a Liberace designed interior? \n\nCalories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo - which was absolutely stellar.  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent, thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  The portions are HUGE - so I have left-overs for lunch today!  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti - he liked it so much he polished it off.  He may as well have licked the plate. \n\nIf you go - don&#x27;t forget to take a peek in the piano lounge (supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there).   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling, a piano-shaped bar, classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs, and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace!  Thursday happy hour has live music too!  Prices are reasonable - our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the street.\n\nCan&#x27;t wait to go back - as Liberace&#x27;s theme song would say....\&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You\&quot;...definitely.&quot;,

However, I didn&#x27;t think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal.  I went with my parents and had this old school, throw back Italian meal.  My mom had the lasagna, a la carte.  Huge piece came out!  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion.  She took half of it to go.  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish (I can&#x27;t remember the name of it).  I tried a couple bites and it was very good.  I had this shrimp and garlic dish (can&#x27;t remember the specific name of it either) but it was very good.  In fact, I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce!  Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara.  I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good.  \n\nA couple weeks later, my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour.  It&#x27;s so wonderful to go into the bar area.  If you like anything that sparkles, you&#x27;ll love this place!  The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor!  They also have live music on Thursday nights.  Not sure if they have different acts, but the night we were there the people were very talented.\n\nMinimum, my husband and I will be back for their happy hour.  I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll make it for dinner too!&quot;,

Carluccio&#x27;s has the old school charm!\n\nThe place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana.  I am guessing it has been here for 20-30 years which is a long time by Vegas standards, so it has some history.  The place has brick walls, old school burgandy colored booths, custom wood door, dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom.  \n\nIt has a bar area, restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly.  \n\nThe menu was typical of a Italian joint.  The prices seemed reasonable.  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate.  It was a large offering with a side of pasta.  Very tasty - the meat sauce was right on!  I tried a friends chicken parm - that was tasty.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is my favorite Italian place in Vegas. It has great local history, being that as Tivoli Garden it was owned by the one and only Liberace! It has one of his pianos in the back seating area and the back bar is grand piano shaped. The food is really, really good and the atmosphere hearkens back to the good old days of Vegas when the Rat Pack and the Mob were headliners. I have gone here for the 13 years I have lived her and consider it a must show to visitors who think the Strip is Vegas. We know better...THIS is Vegas, BABY!&quot;,

This place has been there since the early 1980&#x27;s and you can tell by the decor. They have their fair share of loyal customers including myself. \n\nThe food there is awesome! The seafood diablo is a must have, so is the orange roughy in white sauce. If you like shrimp, the crab stuffed shrimp is great as an appetizer or as an entree. The zuppa the clams is also a great appetizer. \n\nI know service is a hit or miss. This is the same with all restaurants. However, I still give it 5 stars for great food that is not over priced. No one can beat this place.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Being a 2nd generation Sicilian and growing up eating true homade italian cuisine you can expect me to be extremely picky when it comes to italian food.  One of the great things I love about vegas is, if good dego eats is what you crave, chances are you&#x27;ve got a top notch joint with in 5 minutes away from you at any given time, and carluccios is one of the best.  For an old school vegas feel, great service and phenominal food look no further.  Whenever I go I get linguini with muscles, clams, shrimp and calamari.  I can&#x27;t tell you the exact name of the dish, but it comes in red spicy arabiata style sauce and it is to die for.  \n\nWith its central location just minutes from the strip this place is perfect for locals and tourist a like.  If your visiting, do yourself a favor, forget about the overpriced strip hotel restraunts. And pay carluccios a visit you won&#x27;t be disapointed.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m a GoodLife member, and have been for years and years.\n\nSwitching to another gym was pretty much out of the question, as I had a very regimented routine I pretty much &#x27;enjoyed&#x27; at Goodlife, and I&#x27;m very independent, so the lack of experienced trainers, etc is something I cared less about.\n\nYa don&#x27;t mess with a girls&#x27; schedule &amp; routine!\n\nBut I was curious, and when I saw the 30 day pass pop up on GroupOn pop up, it was my opportunity to check this place out .... \n \nWhile the monthly membership is significantly more than what you&#x27;d pay at a chain-facility, you&#x27;re getting completely different caliber of (clearly) highly educated staff, classes that you&#x27;ll actually continue to attend week after week, just so you can see yourself improve. \n \nIt&#x27;s only a bonus the trainers actually work out themselves! (unlike the &#x27;fluffy&#x27; looking staff at most GL&#x27;s) \n \nI&#x27;m not exactly the typical gym-goer; I&#x27;m not there just to go through the motions. I&#x27;m not a cardio bunny.  I want a challenge, I want someone to show me something new.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t realized how stagnant my own workouts had gotten -- I&#x27;d been doing my own training, or I&#x27;d hire an online coach that specializes in what I was doing at that point in time.  I&#x27;d always been providing for myself .. \n\nUNTIL i attended a &#x27;group&#x27; class at Totum.\nI usually don&#x27;t even bother with classes, as I never found them challenging or enjoyed them  ....  \nIt was amazing. I had felt muscles I&#x27;d been working for years, but the variety kicked my ass. And I was hooked from week 1. \n\nI&#x27;m down 2.5\&quot; on my waist, and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks of steady Bells &amp; Balls classes, and a crap load of other classes that are guaranteed to get you into the best shape of your life if you&#x27;re willing to put your heart and soul into it. \n\nI also love that the other members of this facility really do love working out, and pushing themselves ... which is a drastic change from a mediocre facility with a million machines, and personal trainers who are barely &#x27;certified&#x27; under CanFit Pro. \n\nThe staff at Totum are a different caliber: They&#x27;re Kinesoloigists&#x27;, they&#x27;re Physiotherapists ...They&#x27;ve completed Iron Mans&#x27;, triathlon&#x27;s, they can talk to you about Paleo and Ketogenic dieting ...  and they practice what they preach.. they&#x27;re legit. They&#x27;re the real deal.\n\nI am in love with this place.\nI have to admit. \n\nPs. The staff here is pretty freakin&#x27; amazing. And I can be a bit of a &#x27;difficult member&#x27; - but I love these guys!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is my second five-stars review in a row, but it&#x27;s totally deserved.\n\nI am exercising regularly since the high school, and am obviously picky about the gyms. Everything is important for me - professional level of the trainers, quality of the classes, equipment, facilities...\n\nTotum has never disappointed me in more than two years. The place is clean and cared about, with excellent \&quot;machinery\&quot; inside. Staff knows me and my wife by name, they are cheerful, positive and fun people.\n\nProfessional level of \&quot;my\&quot; chiropractor (Rachel Assayag) and personal trainer (Andrew Steinfeld) is exceptional, and boxing classes by Antonio Lopez are always super-fun - can only recommend them wholeheartedly!\n\nImportant point: Not only those guys are great people, they are also a certified professionals - which is not a common trend across the gyms in Ontario. And this is another great value of Totum - people who work with your body here, really know what they are doing.\n\nAnother important thing: Totum is an actual \&quot;sportsman&#x27;s gym\&quot;, not just one of those threadmill-packed \&quot;social clubs\&quot;. No doubt they have all the threadmills you may need, but the classes, sport medicine services and personal training at Totum are a pro-level thing. As such, Totum is not cheap by any means, but every dollar I spend there is worth it.\n\nSo if you are serious about being fit, Totum is probably THE only first-class choice here in Toronto. At least I have not seen anything getting even close to it. Good job guys - keep it running! :-)&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;TOTUM GYM: The gym is very nice, and generally not too busy. I don&#x27;t do the classes, but I heard they are great. The machines are new and the gym is very clean. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a smaller boutique gym, someone who focuses on classes and not heavy weight training (not a lot of machines), or someone who is looking for cardio.\n\nONE WARNING: If you like to work out from 5:30-6:30pm, you will not get a machine. \n\nSERVICES: I have used both Massage and Chiropractic within the gym, and recommend that you don&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s a waste your money. I have gone a few times, massage is hit or miss and the chiropractor gives you 10 minute appointments, as opposed to the 20-30 minutes promised on the website. He is fairly good, but less than half the time is unacceptable.  I always feel ripped off when I go to their clinic, and only went back because it is so convenient that it&#x27;s next door to my house. \n\nIf anyone knows a good massage/chiro in the downtown core, I would love to hear about it! \n\nServices at Totum=2/5\nTotum GYM=5/5!!! --it&#x27;s great!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it&#x27;s been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.\n\nI still haven&#x27;t convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I&#x27;m just too much of a night owl. I&#x27;m also lazy.\n\nClasses to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.\n\nThere is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you&#x27;re going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they&#x27;re open later than most gyms on Fridays.\n\nOne other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It&#x27;s nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.\n\nIt&#x27;s clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I&#x27;d totally recommend you try it out. But only if you&#x27;re awesome.\n\nWorst/best thing - it&#x27;s right next to Soma Chocolate.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I went through a blitz where I tried tons of gyms around TO and it was always Totum that I wanted to come back to.  I joined on a monthly corp rate and it was worth every penny.  I&#x27;d usually go at 2PM or around 7PM and there was never any problem getting on a machine for my warm-ups.  They&#x27;ve got little TVs in front of the elliptical machines, if you want to zone out, or you can hit the treadmill and watch the flow of people down on King below.  \n\nWhat I like most is that the place always feels clean and serene. The interior is long and narrow which offers some privacy.  Music is never overbearing either. \n\n(Diesel Fitness, which used to be around the corner always felt like a nightclub, the place planned out so eyes were drawn to bouncing bums or perfect pecs while music blared and people tried to chat you up.  Totum isn&#x27;t like that at all.)\n\nWinding down after workouts with a steam and then a shower rainforest-style completes the experience. I always feel strong, soothed and focused after my time at Totum.\n\nOnly pitfall really (besides the lack of pool) is that staff, while they try to make the effort aren&#x27;t always good at the follow through.  I&#x27;d booked a free consultation when I started to set up a training program but was told I should visit their chiropractor (at about $110) to discuss my chronic knee and back injuries.  I went to another trainer after that who said she&#x27;d help but got too busy.  I also tried reaching the membership director a few times about extending my membership but never got an email back.  Waiting to see if they bill me anyway. (Had to cancel &#x27;cause I&#x27;m relocating.)\n\nIn other areas their customer service is stellar.  There are weekly seminars by experts in nutrition and fitness.  I took one and learned a ton about balance techniques. The gym sends out monthly newsletters to get people engaged - they do seem to care about their members - and they&#x27;re conscientious about the environment, encouraging everyone to stop buying plastic bottles and bring their own refillable.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been going to Totum for about 3 years now and I love it! The value for the classes outweigh the higher cost per month. I love the midday yoga, pilates and boxing classes the most as they&#x27;re scheduled at a good time. The friday yoga yin is the best, it always leaves body and mind in a peaceful state at the end of the week.\n\nThe personal trainers and instructors are very professional and got me to a level I didn&#x27;t think possible, and I&#x27;m far more aware of my body&#x27;s little kinks, something that would have been ignored completely at other gyms. The cleanliness of the gym and friendliness of the staff (as well as other patrons) lends to a very welcoming and positive environment.\n\nThe other great thing about Totum is the wealth of staff available for other aspects related to wellness. I&#x27;ve used their physio, chiro, massage and acupuncture services so far with great results. I may do more!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The good: beautiful facility, lots of classes, super great admin staff, awesome location. \n\nThe bad: the free personal training session - I was advised not to do any bootcamp classes (apparently I would be predisposing myself to injury). This is silly because I am 24 with no health conditions, and have been exercising regularly for years. I know this was an attempt to get me to pay for PT - but it made me sad :(\n\nThe spin classes were alright, but not a fan of the old bikes that didn&#x27;t display the RPM. Maybe I&#x27;m not the right clientele for this gym, but I was also missing the pump up top 40 beats! \n\nSummary: All the classes were fine, but none were amazingly fun or awesome for $110/month. Maybe more accurate class descriptions would help members know the level and style of each of the classes. I guess specialty fitness classes are the way to go in Toronto?&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;After my issues with Fitness One I was reluctant to join another gym but after being given an offer, I couldn&#x27;t refuse from the BF, I decided to give it a go. The first thing I noticed is how wonderful everyone is at this gym. Very personable, down-to-earth and just generally positive people. I also love that they won&#x27;t take your CC but rather request you pay each month via debit or cheque. They also let you pay month -to-month which is a bonus as you won&#x27;t be committed to 1 year contract.\n\nThe classes are incredible and I am yet to have a less than fabulous experience in them. I also love the variety of classes they have to offer from Yoga, to Spin to Boxing to Pilates etc. They are offered at different times of the day and even a beginner can feel at ease participating.\n\nI also love the rain showers and the steam room. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to have a gym that is respectful and hip. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out. They will give you 1 week free to try it.&quot;,

After having my left rotator cuff royally effed up at a yoga class elsewhere in the city (thank you Mr. Yogi that put me in that arm bind that my body clearly wasn&#x27;t able to do) I needed some serious treatment.  A friend recommended his buddy Dr. Waj Hoda at Totum and as my 4 stars indicate, Yay!  I&#x27;m a fan!  Waj is super knowledgeable and thorough.  His treatments of deep soft tissue massage and acupuncture are precise and effective.  This is not a shee shee foo foo massage.  There shall be no nature sounds and flutes playing in the background. He&#x27;s digging in with his thumbs and elbows and it hurts so good.  You&#x27;ll feel right as rain in no time.  Appointments are a quick and dirty 20 minutes and will do you a world of good.\n\nAs an aside, if I lived or worked in the westend, I&#x27;d totally be a member.  Place is stacked.  Not very often you find a really well-equipped gym that has stylish decor and doesn&#x27;t stink.\n\nOh, and for those that are driving, I recommend parking on Wellington after 4pm.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Big fan of Totum.\nLike other reviewers, I was hooked after the one-week free trial. \nVery clean establishment. Staff are always helpful. Although the weekend hours (they close at 6pm on saturdays) are not so convenient, their AM hours work very well for me. Big bonus for their 7am cycling classes.\n\nMost of all, I love the clientele. Most of the member I have interacted with are health conscious, mature, and adventurous people that have encouraged and motivated me.\n\nAnd, if you need a treat after a rigorous workout, Soma is just next door.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Worst Chiropractic service ever!  I visit and that was enough.  Paid 150 for about a 15 min acupuncture service then a one minute cupping which had to be pulled off as it was causing a spasm up my back.  Still feeling the pain of it.  The Chiropractor didn&#x27;t do any adjustments he said is was out of date treatment.  I could go on but won&#x27;t as I just will never use the service there again.\n\nThe only good thing about the visit was the staff at the service desk they were amazing!!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Had some time to kill before bar hopping on East Fremont, so I walked over to give this place a shot. It reminds me of the mall arcade I used to go to as a child. Not a huge number of games to choose from, but there is a variety in types of games (pinball, racing, skee ball, pop a shot, air hockey, shooters, claw machines, etc).\n\nIt only gets three stars because it lacks in comparison to other arcades in Vegas. Places like Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s and GameWorks blow this place away on size and variety. Hotel arcades on the Strip are better options too (e.g. Midway at Circus Circus and Big Apple Arcade at New York New York). If you&#x27;re a pinball fan, the Pinball Hall of Fame has exponentially more machines and are cheaper to play.\n\nI wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to visit again, but ultimately it&#x27;s not bad. It served its purpose when I had to kill 30 minutes. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I just found out about this place, but thankfully found it by mistake while wandering downtown with friends. So this area is tucked away a lil near the mega denny&#x27;s. It is a tad small on the inside and most of the really cool games are 4 tokens a piece but enough boo hooing. My friend and I had a blast at this place. He was all about the mega space invaders game which was very fun but.. once I saw mario kart in an arcade my nostalgia A.D.D. brain went into seek &amp; destroy mode. I believe you can have up to four racers at a time. My friend picks the hardest track while he boasts his mario kart skills, the race starts the 3rd player was left in the dust meanwhile him and I are neck and neck in the final lap and he is just about to cross the finish line when BOOM turtle shell obliterates him while i win the race :D it&#x27;s just like the good ole days of playing either super or mario kart 64 with your friends. Another fun game there was a new Crusin&#x27; game, which was great. We didn&#x27;t get a chance to explore the whole arcade or play some air hockey , but leaves us something to look forward to upon our next visit. All in all this was a really neat area tucked away in fremont. To the folks bitching about being \&quot;tricked\&quot; into spending alot of money for a crappy prize, uh you ever been to chuck E. Cheese? :P that&#x27;s the way the tickets crumble. I highly suggest checking out this place if you are in the area. GAME ON!&quot;,

I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know about it since I live 5 minutes walking away. Tucked away is probably why.\n\nPlace is really simple and cool. Come play some air hockey, driving games, skeeball or pinball. For a small space they have some good games to play. Some for prizes, tickets or just fun.\n\nMy friends had a blast playing air hockey and pinball for an hour. Place doesn&#x27;t charge to go in and not over priced at all. $1 is four token. Most games take two tokens so a dollar goes far there :)\n\nDefiantly coming back for sure any day I&#x27;m down there or just bored at home. If you are on Fremont look this place up for some fun while you are visiting or living here. If your have kids this is a great escape for you both. Most adults I&#x27;m sure could find something they like! I know I did.&quot;,

We probably only spent $10 and had a good enough time, everything was in working order because the place is new I believe. The have a bathroom, which is a huge plus to me. We liked the pinball games and the retro games, like pacman. \nOur price was a .10 cent sucker. Ironic I wonder what the teenage boy that \&quot;won the big prize\&quot; actually got?&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Fremont Arcade is tucked behind Denny&#x27;s on East Fremont on the first floor of Neonopolis. It&#x27;s a smallish arcade frequented by adults more so than by children. My younger siblings and dad, having frequented larger arcades in Vegas, still had a lot of fun here. My kid brother loved the basketball games and the old man gravitated towards a huge Galaga game. This was hands down the most popular game in the arcade. At some points people were queuing up to play this old classic. There&#x27;s also a an old school Galaga game that only costs 2 tokens to play. My dad played for like 15 minutes and got the second highest score!\n\nThe drawback to this arcade is that it&#x27;s quite expensive. Most games costs 4 tokens ($1) to play. We easily burned through our game play over the course of 30 minutes. Even the pinball machines cost 4 tokens to play! I seen that prizes are available, but I didn&#x27;t see any tickets being dispensed from the games so I don&#x27;t know how prizes work here. Still, the Fremont Arcade is worth a visit, especially if you have kids in tow.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #16&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m always glad to see new businesses opening up in the downtown area. I was especially excited to see a new arcade, and in the old Neonopolis building! I was devastated when Jillian&#x27;s closed as that was a regular spot for me when I was a teenager.\n\nThis arcade has a lot of cool games and they have pinball which I love! I was glued to the pinball machines on my last visit. It&#x27;s pretty spacious too, at least for now. Only gripe I have is that all the games are 4 tokens, $1 each! Hope they do some price adjusting, but I&#x27;ll definitely be back to try some more games.&quot;,

Thomas was so pleasant and helpful as we were greeted and given front side stage seating VIP TREATMENT! The men were respectful and very tasteful, giving all the ladies attention as if they were the only one in the room. I was given two stage performances ,one by \&quot;Ready\&quot;, and boy was he READY! so was I lol, the other gentleman \&quot;Speedy\&quot; I guess was funny as hell. I recommend this place if you wanna have fun that never ends........ladies bring your wallet thing&#x27;s can add up. Is it worth it ? Hell yea! Beware of Dave the MEANIE he&#x27;s a driver for the mansion, he will pick you up , and drop you off back to your hotel if the PRICE is right! Otherwise your stuck at the mansion, he will politely text you and say \&quot;you didn&#x27;t tip so no ride home! plus I&#x27;m off\&quot;. I simply laughed , I&#x27;m from Oakland BABY, I can get down. lol staff handle the situation well providing drinks to me and my girls as they hooked up a ride for us. Would I return yes . Thanks for a wonderful night fellas. I do apologize for this late review .                                                           \n\n\n\n                                                                                        Tameikia&quot;,

When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted.  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated. The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you, also they were really cool about taking pictures. By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back. I hope soon.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My friend and I made reservations online for $30 each which would get us a limo pick up, admission, and two drinks. We were told to be downstairs at a certain area at 9:15. Our limo driver John was 10-15 minutes late and then he couldn&#x27;t find us. I kept telling him where we were and he told us to go an opposite way. All he had to tell us was that he was across the street from us. Instead we walked down the street the wrong way and he flipped a u-turn to get us. When we got to the club with the other girls in the limo they told us he was already in a bad mood before he got us. When we go to pay the cashier told my friend and I $40 each. I argued saying we reserved for $30 but she said our ticket says $40. She told us we&#x27;d get a ride back so we obliged. The moment we sit down at a table 5 different guys were on us asking if we wanted a dance. My friend pointed at me and I guess he whispered to her it was $25. We said nevermind. We had JUST sat down and wanted to warm up and get the feel of the place, these guys were pushy. All of us at the table agreed we were thinking there&#x27;d be a stage show and then mingling time. Instead there was a few short stage shows and the guys were doing lap dances at the same time as the show. You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d give eachother enough respect to not do lap dances during the show since the guy on stage could make more money if everyone was paying attention to him. We spent a few hours here and we were told to call our limo driver for the return ride. I called and texted him. Waited 45 minutes without a response. When I asked one of the girls at the main entrance downstairs for help she said there was nothing they could do since it was another company (in a mean tone and practically rolling her eyes. This makes me think it happens more times then not.) We ubered out of there instead. This experience was supposed to be fun and exciting but instead it felt like a rip off and the customer service was AWFUL and NONEXISTENT. Only help I had was from Thomas who offered us another night with some shots but honestly we never want to go back. I asked for the difference we were forced to pay without getting a ride back and I got that within a few days.&quot;,

It&#x27;s been a week since I went and I&#x27;m still daydreaming about that night, it was AMAZING. It is definitely entertaining and the guys put on a really good show. If you are in vegas for some fun, you definitely have to stop by at least one of your nights. It is so worth it! Trust me! The guys will not disappoint. We&#x27;re already planning our next visit. :p&quot;,

Not to sure about \&quot;Ted\&quot;, but whatever floats your boat, they have it . Hahaha. The $30 cover charge is a great deal for a limo ride to and from your hotel and 2 drinks. I would&#x27;ve spent more than that on just a cab. I liked that it wasn&#x27;t too crowded and we were able to find a table, and this was a Saturday night.  Waiting in line outside kind of sucked, but it went quick. My only regret is that I was so nervous, this being my first time at a male strip club, that I drank too much too quick and we had to leave earlier than my friend would&#x27;ve liked. I can&#x27;t wait to go back, I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it and we&#x27;ll have a much bigger group next time.&quot;,

It was one of those times I asked myself... did she say what I thought she said?  At this point I had no idea what to expect but we were on a mission to have the best bachelorette party we can. \n\nThe staff was friendly and the dancers were very professional. We felt safe here as it was well lit and we could see everything that was going on.  It was a Saturday night and the energy was high.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice. The problem we had was when we asked if my gay best friend could get a lap dance for his 21st birthday a lot of the dancers said they don&#x27;t allow that there. Some finally told us that the owner only allows them in secret rooms and it&#x27;s $150 for 15min instead of the normal 20/25$. That is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner. We finally went to the girl section so he could at least get some kind of lap dance and girl on girl or lesbian action was allowed downstairs. The discrimination there is just terrible and although we made friends with the strippers, will never return.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This was the first male strip club I&#x27;ve been to and I was pretty disappointed. There were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking (IMO, see picture). He was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last. The first dancer from Cali was extremely awkward to watch, he must be new.\n\nI expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill. There weren&#x27;t very many people there for a Thursday night either.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;First off, our host Thomas was awesome.   Kept in contact with me the day off, confirmed our pick up time etc.  When I called our driver for a ride home he said he may or may not be available in 30 minutes.  Thomas got us a ride straight away!   So thank you!    \n \nWe came here with 11 girls for my sister&#x27;s bachelorette party on a Saturday night.  We booked the party package that included an onstage with the bride and entry.  It&#x27;s an additional 30 dollars per girl for 2 drink tickets.  I think a pretty good \&quot;bang\&quot; for your buck, lol.   It is a must to get on that giant golden penis and have a photo.  That thing is hilarious!   \n\nFor some reason every host we had for different events didn&#x27;t recommend this place.  They all were recommending Men of Sapphire or Chippendales.  Since I went to Men of Sapphire for my bachelorette party years ago I wanted something different for my sister.   This is completely a different experience and a more one of one than Men of Sapphire.  Men of Sapphire have more of a stage and you sit afar and watch more of a show. Hunk Mansion the stage is super close and the men use the poles and engage more with the audience.    If you want a crazier night then do Hunk Mansion.   Plus, I found the men a lot sexier at Hunk Mansion than Men of Sapphire.   \n\nThe guys were all superhot; expect the little annoying Guido guy he was our least favorite.   However, all the guys even little Guido had awesome pole skills and every guy was very engaging to all the females.     If you do the package you can pick the guy you want on stage.  So beware, you will be bombarded when you first get there.  So just like Larry H Parker, they will all fight for you ;) I asked the bride to be whom she wanted.   So I recommend the same to other bride to bes.  Oh and seriously girls, if you want your crotch displayed than where a dress.  If not, I recommend wearing jeans.   \n\nThe pick-up and drop off:  \nWe were picked up on time but the bus that took us was super old, air continuing sucked and the speakers were blown in the back.  The ride home was a lot nicer; the party bus was awesome, working air, light show.  I would definitely retire the one that picked us up, especially in Vegas heat we were all sweating in that bus.\n\nThey have hookah at an additional price.  I thought a pretty cool option.   \n\nThe only dislike of the entire night is when I just got a beer and they let the ladies dance on the stage.  Some chick hit my beer with her shoe and spilled it on the ground and everyone saw even the bartender.  Luckily it didn&#x27;t hit me or my friends.  It&#x27;s $15 bucks for a beer since I used a drink ticket.  So logically since I didn&#x27;t dump it and it was their fault they should replace it.  Different story if I spilled the drink I would of just bought another and owned up to it.  But it was obvious they knew the girl did it.  The bartender gave me total attitude but did give me a replacement, but he definitely didn&#x27;t want to.  He said, oh any other place wouldn&#x27;t do it. I was quite pissed, for a 50 cent beer I got such attitude.  Not from Stixxxs but the other one.   Stixxxs was super cool, lite your cigarette for you, made some pretty awesome shots. It&#x27;s the little things that girls remember and such a small gesture would of gone miles.   But he decided to be a dick about it.   \n\nOverall, I gave 5 stars even with the rude bartender because the show was great and everyone had a great time.  \n\nOh and seriously a must to stop by the Hustler store.  They have some awesome stuff in there!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Was not overly impressed. We have been talking about Hunk Mansion for a friend&#x27;s bachelorette party for months and decided to finally book- the reviews sounded great, and we were so excited about the mechanical penis! We were all ready to throw down however much it would cost to get the bachelorette a ride on it! We called to book our reservation and the guy on the phone was rude. We specifically had questions about when to arrive in order to be able to sit all together and he told us he wouldn&#x27;t be able to seat us together unless we reserved a table for more money. The table reservation included two free drink tickets each so we went ahead with it. Our driver was very nice and the ride was pleasant, but we arrived at Hustler? Everyone kept reassuring us this was actually Hunk Mansion though there was not a single sign that said anything confirming we were actually in the right location. We were able to go in fairly quickly, but in order to get to the male strip club, they walked us through the female strip club, which once again did not make us feel like we were in the right place since Hunk Mansion was so advertised as being geared towards women. When we got up to the venue the view was nice, both in scenery and eye candy, but the place was empty except one other party. Good thing we were pressured into buying the more expensive package to get a table together! We were swarmed with good looking guys, very nice, but also VERY persistent in pressuring us to buy expensive dances and drinks. I went with my friend to use our free drink tickets- she ordered champagne and I ordered wine. As she was talking to me, I witnessed the bartender begin to pour her glass of champagne, then when he thought we weren&#x27;t looking, swap to another unlabeled bottle that was already open, then when she turned around he finished it off with the original champagne bottle. I told her what had happened and the bartender denied switching bottles even though I had watched him! He ended up giving her the rest of the mini champagne bottle for free after we complained. Later on we decided to buy shots- the special was $5 Malibu shots, and when they came out they were pink! Since when is Malibu pink? I might have overlooked all this if they actually had a mechanical penis as advertised, but there was none to be found. :( This was not our first rodeo, but definitely our last at Hunk Mansion.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Mannnn do I have lots to say about this place, good and bad. We came here for a bachelorette party on 11/4/17 that we pre-booked with a group of us girls; had no idea where it was until I realized its part of the Hustler Club. \n\nGood: \nThe place is pretty nice! There is a bar, a stage, plenty of seats and tables, as well as an outdoor area (outdoor area was my fav)! Everything was fairly clean and nice- as well as the restrooms! Not as large as Sapphires stage and room, but still well done. \n\nThe amount they charged us to get in was fairly reasonable? I believe $30-45 which includes transportation and two well drinks. (Not exactly sure which deal we got)\n\nAlso,You have some pretty awesome people working there! \nIxtsel (the hostess at the front), David (our host/server at the table), Trent (behind the bar, and Marcus (the DJ) were all a great help. They answered any and all questions I Had and were very friendly! Trent and David helped us finally get some water after asking several times and Ixtsel even sent a follow up email to me that night! When all of us were waiting on paid dances for the bride, maid of honor, and friends, DJ Marcus was able to reassure me they had gotten it, helped us stay on a schedule, and let us know when to be ready. \nThank you to them!\n\nBad:\n1. The bus taking us to the event was hard to contact and did not finally contact us until 20 minutes after I had talked to another man. We were late and picked us up about 40-45 minutes after the original pick up time. Do you know how stressed that makes a Maid of Honor with everyone at the hotel room?! \n\n2. Once we got there and had gotten seated, we had so many people who worked there telling us we had to move, then that we didn&#x27;t have to move, then that we had to pay $200, then that we had to pay $400 on top of the entrance fee. \nPLEASE- just give us a manager and let them tell us the exact amount. \n\n3. Afterwards when we did get a manager, we were told that it was the wrong table that they had to talk to and that we were able to stay. -_-\nBut of course only AFTER one of us has paid 300 for a bottle because we thought we had to leave. Way to hustle!\n\n4. Obviously these guys work on tips/lap dance money. So yes, some of them are fairly aggressive. If you&#x27;re not good at saying no, don&#x27;t go here. Luckily I&#x27;m pretty good at eyeing them to back off hahahahha \n\n5. The bride had to pee as soon as we got out of the place. Most places don&#x27;t let you back in, which is fine. Just don&#x27;t blame it on her being \&quot;too drunk\&quot;. Just say it&#x27;s because we need to pay again to enter. We get it.\n\n6. The entertainment was fairly slow. At some points no one was on stage and you could barely figure out why you paid money and you were sitting there with no guys around. Every now and then a show would take place with some guy and their lap dance person, after the DJ would call for that person 5x to get them on stage. No schedules. Also, very rarely was I impressed with some of the guys \&quot;dancing\&quot;. At least they look good, right? \n\n7. Obviously the ATM is a NO GO other than your bank. There are always fees when using ATMs. No matter what. But normally it&#x27;s around 3.75 high. NOPE. This one charged $12. DONT DO IT. \n\n8. Don&#x27;t bother checking in for that \&quot;Free Shot\&quot;. Didn&#x27;t even work when I went up and asked for that person. AND you get a nasty look like you faked the check in offer. I never want to feel that way when presenting a Yelp check in offer. \n\nTo summarize: Hunk mansion is within the Hustler club- and you will get hustled. Hold your ground, call for management when needed for your ride because they won&#x27;t call you to tell you their late, ask when in doubt about pricing and ASK for a manager rather than taking word from 4 different hosts, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get anything without nagging for it, and be friendly with the staff. Some of them can make your night- and give the place more stars.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I went with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party. Besides walking through our group on the way to the stage, the guys gave us no attention at all. I actually had to get up and walk around to find a guy standing around to give my friend a dance. We all had money to spend and couldn&#x27;t get a guy to come over to us. \n\nAlso, we were sitting near the guys&#x27; dressing room and I could hear them complaining about having to go on stage for another dance. It was only 10 o&#x27;clock, so I&#x27;d hate to see them by 2! \n\nWhile OG isn&#x27;t as nice of a venue, the guys and the service is a thousand times better. \n\nOverall bad experience. We&#x27;re actually planning a make-up bachelorette party for my friend at OG.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Recently, I learned that there&#x27;s a shortage of male strip clubs and revues in Las Vegas. That&#x27;s definitely news to someone (me) who doesn&#x27;t think the concept is appealing. With that being said, I was actually the one who found this place -- via Yelp, heh -- and suggested to my female cousins -- who are male strip club aficionados --  that they add Hunk Mansion to their itinerary. In short, I ended up going for the hell of it to see why they get so worked up over guys gyrating in sparkly thongs.\n\nEntry fee to the club is $25. This price includes two free drink tickets and shuttle service from your hotel, via Hustler bus. That&#x27;s a pretty sweet deal considering how entry fees alone to some of the clubs on The Strip are around the same price.\n\nHunk Mansion is located inside Larry Flynt&#x27;s Hustler Club that&#x27;s just a short drive from the south end of The Strip. It&#x27;s a small, intimate room that&#x27;s next door to where the women perform. It&#x27;s equipped with a bar, large stage, and plenty of seating and tables. \n\nThe free drinks we ordered were weak and diluted, and the paid drinks were the opposite. But hey, can&#x27;t complain much about free drinks.\n\nWe had to wait for a couple of groups to arrive before the performances started. Amateurs kick-off the night, and it&#x27;s up to the ladies to decide if they&#x27;re Hunk Mansion material. Once that&#x27;s done, the resident performers get on stage. The whole time I was expecting bump and grind movements, but I gotta give some of these performers props for climbing up 10 foot poles and doing some Cirque du Soleil-like tricks. If I can&#x27;t do that, then they deserve some of my singles to pay for their college tuition. \n\nFrom what I&#x27;ve been told, the men at Hunk Mansion are more attractive than the performers at other male strip clubs and revues in Vegas. There were a few dancers who were on the douchey side and all talk and no game. However, in general, the guys at the club were polite and didn&#x27;t pressure us into paying for dances. Few even came around to ask if we were enjoying the show. Staff members even came by to check on everyone and make sure that they were having a great time. I can&#x27;t recall all of their names, but my cousins went crazy for Xavier, Trey, Pitbull, Silk, and Superman. Give those guys money.\n\nI think Hunk Mansion is an ideal place for a bachelorette party or just to visit with friends who enjoy this particular type of entertainment. I&#x27;m still not a fan, but the experience was better than I thought it was going to be. It gets my seal of approval. Have fun, ladies! And don&#x27;t forget to do a Yelp check-in to receive a light-up tiara. \n\nAnd this marks my 400th review!&quot;,

Any time we have a special occasion for one of us girls in our group we call Thomas and he tells us the best package to get and sets up our limo transportation and makes sure he has a table reserved for us. He&#x27;s always helpful and tells you like it is. We always leave there having the best time ever! I highly recommend this place for all you girls out there wanting to have a good time.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My friends and I came to check this club out for the first time in July 2013. We paid $45 for the VIP admission, which included reserved seats, limo pick up and drop off, and two drinks. The dancers are very friendly and personable, and the acts were varied and exciting. The guys are very ripped and give you plenty of attention. They don&#x27;t mind if you take pictures, either. We were treated to shots of tequila so that was pretty cool, too. When I checked in on yelp, they didn&#x27;t have light up tiaras but they gave me a giant Hustlers cup filled with tons of awesome goodies. There&#x27;s also a mechanical penis ride which makes for great laughs and photos. Hunk Mansion is definitely worth checking out, especially for bachelorette parties or anyone wanting some eye candy (or more). Shout out to the cute bartender and Superman! Oh, and Thomas-super awesome host that will personally see to it that you&#x27;re having a good time. Amazed by the customer service! This was a lot of fun and I can&#x27;t wait to come back!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been pondering this review for some time... I don&#x27;t want it to in any way convince other&#x27;s not to go to Hunk Mansion, as I think it&#x27;s just not my personal cup of tea (especially considering all the other 5 stars).   \n\nAfter doing some heavy yelp research, I settled on Hunk Mansion for my best friend&#x27;s bachelorette party.  Personally, I had never been to a male strip club (no there isn&#x27;t real nudity here, they stay in thongs) but the reviews were great, and riding the mechanical penis sounded like it was right up our alley.   We saw on the website that $25 would get you a ride to and from, 2 drink tickets and entry.  We called around 11pm (after our initial contact on the contact form was ignored) and a limo driver showed up right on time at midnight as we had asked.  The driver was awesome, friendly and allowed us to take many a drunken photo in front of the limo - the limo itself was a bit old, but nothing worth complaining about.  Once dropped off he told us he would be our ride back to the hotel whenever we were ready.\n\nInside, I checked in on yelp... both cashiers looked confused when I mentioned the yelp check in offer (the light up tiara) and eventually decided who ever was in charge of that wasn&#x27;t there that evening (it was a Sunday).  Strike one, but whatever.  Then we were told the price was $30 something a person.  I told them the website had said $25.  They then said the price was $28 a person, and then dropped it lower to $25.  Anyways, I was a bit annoyed but still enjoying the fun.  \n\nWe walked straight to the back, bypassing the female dancer area, and stopped at the area to get dollar bills.  Service here was much slower than any other strip club I&#x27;ve ever been to!   Some of the girls stopped at the bar here too, this was insanely slow... and to top it off the mechanical penis was broken!! \n\nContinuing on we ended up in the male dancer section.  It was empty, perhaps due to it being so late on a Sunday night.   It seemed weird to me that there wasn&#x27;t a guy on stage at all times, but this may be due to the fact that there were only about 4 guys.  The guys came over, and like the other reviewers mentioned they tried to take time to talk to us... nice I guess, but didn&#x27;t interest me much.  Plus I felt as though they were desperately begging for money....  after about an hour we finally ditched the guys and had a much better time watching the female strippers do some incredible pole climbing tricks....\n\nAll in all, it was an ok night, ended badly when we had to get a taxi back to our hotel though - apparently our driver was busy driving someone else for an hour!  The party also spent some time in the Hustler store connected to the club which was fun.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Where do I even begin.....\n\nQuick note for those of you that don&#x27;t want to read everything I am writing... just know that EVERYTHING THEY ADVERTISE IS FALSE.\n\nFirst off, Hunk Mansion is really Hustlers. Honestly this place was not what was advertised. \n\nFrom the beginning the driver was 50 minutes late to pick us up from our hotel. The website said, \&quot;first come first serve.\&quot; We did not want to be late and miss out on our table. The driver said to us, \&quot;Don&#x27;t worry! there&#x27;s only 5 drivers and we are all running behind. If you where ready then you should have called me to get you sooner!\&quot; Wish this would have been communicated to me sooner. Once the driver picked us up, he was honestly an awesome man. I would give Raul 5 stars alone. He gave me his own card and told me to call him 30 minutes before I needed to be picked up and he was right on time for pick up. Raul really made up for being late. \n\nArriving.... We went in through a side elevator...REALLY SKETCHY!! The \&quot;bouncer\&quot; was really sketchy also. The bouncer mentions the 1st and 2nd floor where girl strippers and the top floor was men.\n\nRight when we sat down we where bombarded with men asking us for dances. Honestly, I know you need to make your money, but give us a second to put our stuff down and get our drinks!! You would make better money if you make things about the \&quot;Customers.\&quot; \n\nI previously paid for a bottle service online through the \&quot;Hunk Mansion Website.\&quot; I had to ask for our bottle 4  times before I was told to go walk up to the manager up front. Fine! I did so. We finally receive our bottle and glasses. Cheap bottle! AND ALL THE WINE GLASSES STILL HAD LIPSTICK ALLLLLL OVER THEM!!!!! I did not drink my Champagne in fear that I would get something from the F-ing glass!! This is not SANITARY!!! We had to ask for new glasses...\n\nNext..... Online advertised a \&quot;$60 Cash\&quot; Dance on stage of a \&quot;Dancer You Want and Pay Him Direct.\&quot; This was not the case. I had to walk up front to pay some guy and find out that \&quot;the dance is no longer $60. My manager changed it last week to $75.\&quot; I told them that I saw the add for $60 and asked if they could honor that. The said \&quot;No, $75 or nothing.\&quot; Fine!! Gave them the $75 and said, \&quot;I know what guys my sister wants a dance from. The add says she gets to pick the dancer. \&quot;They said \&quot;No, she doesn&#x27;t get to pick.\&quot; We where also promised a Tiara for The bride, but we never received that. Everything they advertised was FALSE!!  ( I will attach pictures of what was advertised). \n\nHonestly, I did everything I could to just get my sister drunk so she wouldn&#x27;t pay attention to the little things. \n\nSide note: The dancers here were really good, but extremely aggressive. \n\nI could go on and on about this place, but I will leave it at that. I hope everyone else has better experiences.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Marathon Diner may not look fancy, but I had the best airport meal of my life here!  Skip the long line at McDonald&#x27;s and head to Marathon for authentic, fresh, made-to-order Greek diner food.\n\nThe veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and feta cheese.  So good, and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers, cheese, etc., so I&#x27;m sure they would accommodate special requests.  I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option, because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad! \n\nObviously I was just here for dinner, but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport. You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;During the recent Yelp scavenger hunt event my husband and I got to this place as one of the last venues. We were pretty full from eating elsewhere but told them if they would bag our sample we would eat it at home. They were more than happy to do this for us.\n\nI asked them as far as other locations were concerned. This is the only one in the city and it is Greek themed. When we finally were able to have our \&quot;doggie bag\&quot; I was pleased that they gave us a small gyro which is one of their specialties, along with lemon chicken soup, and oyster crackers. Believe me it did not disappoint. It was just enough for a light meal later.\n\nThey have a rewards program that if you buy 7 sandwiches or salads then you get the 8th one free. When i got home I had a chance to review the menu in detail. the serve a vegetarian gyro, specialty burgers and specialty sandwiches along with sides. Everything is ala carte however, you can get a side of fries and coleslaw at a reduced price if you order a sandwich.\n\nBreakfast items are available as well which does includes omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, French toast, and two eggs your way. Expect to pay a little more since you are at the airport but they are on par with some of neighborhood diners I have visited. \n\nSince it is part of the fast casual approach don&#x27;t expect table service however, there is a food court eating area behind the row of fast food eateries on the left side of the center core.\n\nThey do offer egg white substitutes if you have health issues. The only thing I found lacking on their menu was desserts. All they offer is rice pudding. Don&#x27;t expect to see those gigantic pies and cakes you would normally find.\n\nStill they have a good variety of Greek fare selections which is a novel approach to casual dining whether you plan to eat there or take it with you in flight.\n\nNow that non passengers can visit the airside terminal during weekdays only this place is a must return for me next time I find myself out that way.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for dinner.  We had both been past marathon diner before and never thought much of it.  As a matter of a fact I was avoiding it, not for any particular reason.  So why did I come here you ask?  Well we had a Yelp elite event at the airport and their food was actually quite good and so I decided to stop on my next personal trip.  Since it&#x27;s located in the airport there isn&#x27;t too much to say about it other than it&#x27;s a counter in the center core.  They serve breakfast all day long and I believe their name is Marathon in order to reference their Greek roots.\n\nFor dinner on this day my wife and I both decided to get gyros with fries.  After about a five minute wait our food was ready.  The first thing that I tasted were our fries which were quite good.  They were piping hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next up was the gyro which seemed wet and quite messy.  As a matter of a fact I didn&#x27;t even try to pick it up with my hands and ate it with a fork from the start.  The gyro meat inside of it was good and there was a good amount of it.  It had vegetables of lettuce, tomato and onion which gave it color and made it feel healthier.  Last but certainly not least was the tzatziki sauce which tasted good but seemed rather watery.  It was bad enough that I debated about whether or not to eat the pita.  Since I was hungry, I did but a soggy pita isn&#x27;t that great.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Minus the soggy pita, I enjoyed everything that I had here and my wife did as well.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I went here as part of a food tasting event. I got to try the lamb gyro, as well as the Greek lemon chicken soup.\n\nThe gyro was absolutely delicious. The pita was warmed and the lamb was fresh, flavorful, and not greasy at all.  The gyro had the perfect amount of toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion) and the tzatziki sauce was delicious - it was definitely homemade, creamy and tangy, with lots of dill for flavor.  The gyro was proportioned very well, where you could get a little bit of everything in each bite!\n\nThe lemon chicken soup was something I&#x27;ve never had before so it was a kick to the face in flavor that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. It is very tangy, just shy of sour, with perfectly cooked orzo, small bits of chicken, and a flavorful chicken broth that was a bit thicker than your standard chicken soup. It was served with oyster crackers which I didn&#x27;t use because the soup was delicious on its own and didn&#x27;t need them. I will definitely look for lemon chicken soup on the menu the next time I visit a Greek establishment!\n\nThe items I got to try were cooked to order, flavorful, and comforting.  I was very impressed with the quality of each and every ingredient and the elevated taste of a standard gyro, without the guilt. Marathon Diner is definitely a solid choice for those wanting some quick comfort food at an affordable price. I will absolutely be back for another gyro the next time I am Pittsburgh International Airport - check it out!&quot;,

I was expecting a not so good sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised that it was good! I would definitely eat here again to try what&#x27;s on the menu for lunch/dinner. The workers were friendly and quick. Exactly what you want out of an airport restaurant.&quot;,

I came to this specific location and literally everyone there was very kind and helpful. Their plus size section was quite small and they didnt have any workout clothing there. I managed to find a couple items I liked but the prices are similar to their competitors. Basically to spend less/get more join their free rewards program (card) and go during their bogo/special sales. I hope the other locations are bigger in town - as I was told. Overall good experience. I just wish this particular store had better/bigger selection and was priced a little lower. Thank you for the good experience.&quot;,

It&#x27;s about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. \n\nIt is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don&#x27;t remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. \n\nThe wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn&#x27;t have to wait too long for a table. \n\nIf we&#x27;re in the mood for mexican food and don&#x27;t want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place.&quot;,

There aren&#x27;t any prices listed, but we decided to try a Bavarian Cream filled Empanada, Peanut Butter Polvoron, and a Puercito which all came out to $2.\n\nThey were not the best I&#x27;ve had, but they were okay. The selections you may find at Mariana&#x27;s or Cardena&#x27;s may cost a little more, but the quality is better. All is not lost though...A Mexican Neveria(Ice Cream Shop) is also next door on the opposite side of Mama Maria&#x27;s Restaurant, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots for desserts and snacks.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My go-to on the northeast side of town.\n\nInside this small restaurant sits about 40 people. Seating is open to your preference. Booths are comfy, but limited leg space (tall people problems). The noise level is always calm since it&#x27;s never packed. Sit on the left side if you want to watch some Tele&#x27;Mundo Lol.\nDecorations consist of paintings on walls and some hanging Latin streamers.\n\nAs far as the 4 page menu goes, everything is under $15, there&#x27;s a wide variety to choose from, and all are very filling. The Fajitas with your choice of any meat always comes out packed with a ton of flavor. I get the shrimp and they never fail to impress this picky gut. Enchilada Style Burritos and Chimichangas are huge! The weird part is, they are the cheapest entrees on the menu too. They do not charge extra if you substitute for steak, only on the shrimp.\nFood doesn&#x27;t take but 10 minutes to come out, but while you wait, freshly made delicious tortilla chips and salsa are brought out to keep you happy. To tell you the truth, its the biggest reason I keep coming back. :D\nAfter dining in, make sure to stop by next door to their linked bakery for some fresh pastries to take home. So worth your money.\n\nOverall I will have to say from the prices and quality, there&#x27;s no need for Lindo Michioacan if you reside in the area. Great job, chef!&quot;,

The staff is friendly, it&#x27;s not very big or fancy but we&#x27;ve never had a problem with seating and the service is fast so they turn over tables quickly.  Definitely recommend.  We go every few months and have always liked whatever we have... recommend going next door to La Flor De Michoacan for dessert after or stopping by the connected bakery for a sweet treat.  We often go there for donuts on the weekend.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Mama Maria&#x27;s was wonderful. We arrived at open on a Wednesday, by the time it was 1130, the place was packed. Large portions, wonderful flavor, decent prices. The bakery was a treat. Amazing prices, great customer service. We are going to return!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My dad always used to tell me that the best Mexican food comes from \&quot;hole in the wall\&quot; places. I wouldn&#x27;t quite call Maria&#x27;s a \&quot;hole in the wall\&quot;, but it is a very small Mexican restaurant with some of the best authentic food in town. The attached bakers is also extremely good with low prices.\n\nI came here the first time a few years ago after a friend told me that his daughter, who had moved out of Las Vegas, comes here every time she returns to Vegas to visit. I was hooked from the very first meal. I grew up eating Mexican food in Southern California, and though there are a lot of good restaurants in Las Vegas, Maria&#x27;s stands above most of them.\n\nI don&#x27;t know where to start on the food, as we&#x27;ve never had anything bad here. Everyone we have ever taken here or brought with us loves the food here. The surf and turf burrito (carne asada and shrimp) is just phenomenal. The steak is fantastic, the shrimp is seasoned perfectly, the burrito is huge, and it&#x27;s served wet with a perfect enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I honestly don&#x27;t think there is anyway for this burrito to get better.\n\nThe combo meals are very good to. Choose from enchiladas, tacos, mini-burritos, chili rellenos, etc... You honestly cant go wrong no matter what you order. They have a combo meal that comes with carne asada, an enchilada, a chimichanga and a chili relleno for $18. It&#x27;s a massive meal and enough for two people to share, and everything is high quality.\n\nThe restaurant is very small, with only about a dozen tables and only one server working. Despite how good this place is, it never seems to be packed, so we always get very good service.\n\nThe Bakery is right next door to the dining area. The Mexican pastries are very good, and they are dirt cheap. I love their pineapple pastries and macaroons in particular, though most of the other items are good to. The only thing I really don&#x27;t care for is their cookies, which are very large but crumbly and dry. If you like dryer cookies (and some people do, my wife always gets a peanut butter cookie every time we are here) then you will probably love these. Nothing wrong with their flavor, but I&#x27;ll take moist and chewy cookies over crumbly and dry any day.\n\nIn my opinion, this place is a hidden gem that is well worth trying. If you are a fan of Mexican food, then I would try to make it here some day.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We enjoy eating at this Mexican Restaurant a couple of times a month.  You are served Hot Giant Tortilla Chips with Fresh Tasty Salsa before every meal.  I&#x27;ve tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.  My husband usually gets whatever the special is for that day and it&#x27;s always delicious.  The Restaurant is open to the Bakery so it&#x27;s hard to pass up on a dessert.  The service is always personal and friendly.  This Restaurant is located on 6055 E Lake Mead Blvd and I would say give it a try.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;When in the area of Lake Mead &amp; Mt. Hood (God knows why?) you could easily pass this diamond in the rough if you were not looking.  Situated in a small strip mall with an adjoining bakery is some of the yummiest mexican chow in town. There are a million little witty cliches you could use to describe what me and my buddy affectionately call, \&quot;Mamma&#x27;s.\&quot;\n\nThe dining area is small and adds to the intimacy of the meal be it lunch or dinner.  The booths are very comfortable and no matter how hot it gets outside it&#x27;s always cool inside.  The staff is always friendly.  If we are sitting in within eye shot of the chief, we are sure to acknowledge him with a polite head nod and \&quot;How are you?\&quot;\n\nIn the past I have attempted to search out items on the menu with each visit making it something new......That was until I told to forget everything and order a plate of \&quot;Polo A La Diabla.\&quot;  Bites of chicken in a molle sauce/enchilada sauce, or so we think.  They tell us the actually recipe is a secret. The meal comes with rice, beans and tortillas.  If I may make a suggestion, order a plain quesadilla to dip or swipe the remaining sauce.\n\nEverything is simple with that old mexican restaurant kind of feel you experienced as a kid before the Zabbas and the other commercialized mexican food restaurants came around.  I feel a true sense of sadness when the meal is over.\n\n*Just remember to not leave any valuables in your car and make sure it is locked.*&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Wow! How did I not know about this place? The tortillas and salsa here are freaking amazing(warm are mild and light... not like the heavy greasy-grainy chips most Mexican places in this hood serve). My friend and I had two baskets, while hilariously holding ourselves back! I noticed a couple people came in to get chips and salsa for takeout.\n\nI had the carnitas(~$8, on special). They were perfectly portioned and the pork portion was authentic: chunks of roasted meat/ no gross puddles of fat--Neither dry-shredded nor blank. I&#x27;m now craving a second helping of carnitas, although I have dinner plans at a certain posh strip joint. \n\nMy friend had one of their sizzling steak dishes--she commented literally 10 times how tender it was. Service was great. \n\nTheir menu has just enough variety(I like it that way) and an easy-going ambiance(nice decor for a stip-mall-esque hole-in-the-wall). I checked out the bakery nearby and will definitely return for the delicious flan. Winner!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Ate here once a week, sometimes twice, while I lived in Vegas. This is the most wonderful little Mexican restaurant I&#x27;ve ever dined at. The service and food remained consistent for years, since my first time in &#x27;09. I&#x27;m so in love with Mama Maria&#x27;s that I rhyme. I don&#x27;t miss Vegas, I miss this restaurant.\n\nI had a few coworkers who feel the way I do. First, the salsa. Perfect. We&#x27;d finish at least two bowls and take it to go, too. Garlicky, cilantro heaven. Unlike any other salsa. Beans and rice? Pretty standard, but somehow tasted better on my go-to shrimp taco plate. Flour tortillas, please! Succulent, buttery shrimp, with the cheese perfectly melted on the tortilla. No one does it this way. Pico, lettuce, add guacamole... Simple? Absolutely. And yet, nowhere makes it taste like this!\n\nService is always phenomenal. Over the years there were a few different waitresses, most of them remembering my order. All managing the full (small) restaurant on their own. Chef always waves. Hole in the wall? Slightly. You&#x27;ll get over it.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adorable - maybe a dozen tables?  Mom and Pop type place, but the service is usually really quick. \n\nThey bring you a basket of fried mini tortillas to break off and have with their salas...and if you empty your basket they ask if you want more... Seriously, they shove food in your face. Its like going to the Mexican Grandmother&#x27;s house you never knew you had.  \n\nI used to only get the shrimp enchiladas, but now that I have branched out I have to say there isn&#x27;t an enchilada on their menu I wouldn&#x27;t eat and I like their tacos too. Husband always gets their burritos and likes them.  For a sit down Mexican restaurant Husband and I won&#x27;t go anywhere else.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Tucked away in one of those strip mall type locations, I would recommend even taking a 20 minute drive to go here. The food tastes authentic and homemade, order a corona and they bring you a frosted mug and a lime to pour it into, and the free chips and salsa are flat fried tortilla chips still glistening with oil and freakishly good. Highly recommend&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I am sooooooo happy I finally stopped in here. What a true little gem in this area. I had a lunch date with my parents today and my dad has been craving Mexican food so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. So in my semi conscious food coma I am going to write this review the best I can. Ha! \n\nIts a tiny restaurant that packs a huge punch with flavors. I think I counted eight tables so if you plan to come with a larger party call in advance to make sure there is space. When I walked in the first thing  I noticed was the delicious combinations of smells. On top of the yummy Mexican spices it is also attached to a bakery so definitely stop in there afterwards. \n\nWe were greeting by a friendly waitress who took our drink orders immediately and then promptly brought out hot crispy tortillas and salsa. The salsa was sooooo yummy. I actually took an extra order to go. \n\nMy dad had the chile verde with corn tortillas, my mom ordered the chile relleno, and I had a cup of albondigas soup along with the enchiladas verdes.  Everything was amazing! Both my parents cleaned the plate! I have honestly never seen them do that before haha! The sauce on my enchiladas was so tasty and it was packed with moist perfectly spiced chicken. I took multiple bites of my parents food and it was just as good. We all liked it so much we plan to come back here very soon. \n\nNot only was it delicious but it&#x27;s easy on the wallet. Our bill was only $42 and that included beer and soft drinks. That&#x27;s pretty good for 3 people. \n\nDon&#x27;t let the area or the size of the place scare you. Stop in and give it a try.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Salsa lived up to expectations from previous reviews. Only drawback and this is purely personal preference, was the level of saltiness. I prefer less salt but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. I wanted the carnitas but unfortunately it was not available during the time I visited. Opted for the California burrito (chicken). Everything that was served was hot and fresh. I feel this review would have been 4 stars if the carnitas would have been available.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I gave this place a try, Mama Maria&#x27;s is a small restaurant with a couple booths and tables.  After ordering drinks they bring a basket of fried tortillas and salsa. The tortillas were still hot when I was breaking them apart to dip in the salsa and the salsa was delicious!  It was flavorful without having to be spicy.  You could tell it was fresh because the diced up onions were still crisp and the cilantro was nice and green.  \n\nWe ordered the Tampiquena, which was recommended by our server, and the Spicy Devil Chicken.  The Tampiquena was great!  A perfectly marinated flap steak with enchilada, beans, rice, salsa, and guacamole.  The Spicy Devil Chicken was alright.  It was a little too salty for my taste, but I asked for a side of crema and that was able to fix it.  \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we walked to the bakery that&#x27;s connected to the restaurant and picked out some pastries to get for dessert.  Most of the items there are less than a dollar!  We got a bag of pastries for less than $3!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Stopped in one evening for dinner after hearing about how good this place was. The restaurant itself is a bit small with some booths and tables  against the wall, we sat ourselves after not seeing anyone in the restaurant. After about 10 minutes we finally had our server come out and give us menus along with bringing us chips and salsa. \n\nWe ordered the chili verde and the enchilada trio, both had good taste and came out quick but not something I would rave about. The prices are really reasonable here with most items not costing more $12 and drinks being at about $5 which makes for a really inexpensive Mexican meal.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;As authentic as you can get! This restaurant is so small, but it gets pretty crackin! Once you enter, you are welcomed with great servers who will accommodate  you and your party or even if its just a party of one! The restaurant is decorated with a mural of people from Mexico and great art that just resembles its amazing culture.\n\nThe restaurant seating options are booths and tables. Once you are seated, you are given complimentary chips and salsa! The chips are fresh and right out of the fryer! They give you a lot of chips and plenty of their homemade salsa! I cannot get enough of these! When I first came here, I was hooked! I probably go here at least once every two weeks. It is just THAT good. I have ordered plenty of things and I will just list some of the food that I can remember.\n\nSizzling fajitas- I usually get the shrimp and chicken combo. It comes with the sides such as the guacamole, rice, beans, and pico de gallo with some sour cream on the plate and tortillas-- your choice of flour or corn! Then, you are served with a sizzling plate that will catch another persons eyes! It makes them want to order one, too!\n\nShrimp in Butter Garlic- I love shrimp and these shrimps are huge and covered in butter garlic sauce with rice on the side. All I can say is.... damn. SO DELICIOUS!\n\nAppetizer Combo- This combo comes with chicken flautas, chicken fingers, guacamole, cheese quesadilla and plenty more all for less than $10! It will fill you up and plenty for people to share.\n\nBurritos- Man... their burritos are HUGE! Get any style burrito.. you won&#x27;t regret it! It is something you have to see AND taste for yourself.\n\nThis was an accidental find, but i&#x27;m glad I decided to go check it out! Great place and great staff!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We used to go to Mama Maria&#x27;s many years ago but for some reason stopped.\nWe have gone 3 times in the last month or so for dinner.  This is a very americanized mexican restaurant and you very seldom see latinos here except for the staff.\nFood is very good and portion sizes are average for the $$.  Ignacio and I both had a shrimp dish and while he got 7 shrimp I only had 6 in my order. Most places normally include 8 shrimp but we have noticed a cut down to 7 lately but never 6. Beans and rice are decent and the best thing is they do not overload the food with white and yellow cheese like a lot of places. Service has been good and friendly. as this is a small place sometimes there is only 1 waitress doing it all.\nWe love the tostada size chips and salsa they serve you to start.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Legit Mexican food from a small homey shop.\nWe had the green enchiladas and the mole enchiladas. Both were delicious. I&#x27;ve been kinda into mole for a couple months, and I thought Mama Maria&#x27;s sauce stood up there with some of the best I&#x27;ve had. Of course it is rich, so if you like something a little fresher tasting, the green sauce was really excellent. We both commented on the quality of the meat - tender, juicy, not blobby. The enchiladas are served 3 to a plate, with sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans. I loved the beans - made me think about the runny beans I used to have from my friends&#x27; nana&#x27;s growing up. The rice is blander and not my favorite, but then rice is never my favorite.\nThe chips were a pleasant surprise - whole tortilla size, like at the old Supermex (Cantina Jalisco). Light and crunchy with a flavorful salsa.\nPrices were good: $13 for an iced tea and the huge enchilada plate, which could easily be split. I might like to see them add a couple lunch specials to the menu (or maybe I just missed them...).\nIt&#x27;s kinda in the hood, but that&#x27;s half the allure of Mama Maria&#x27;s.\nIt&#x27;s close to work, so I&#x27;ll definitely be back for lunch, and hopefully I can drag the family up here sometime for dinner, too.\nBonus: it&#x27;s connected to a Mexican bakery, where I picked up a dozen butter cookies to go.&quot;,

Today, I finally got bored enough to make the drive and try it for myself.\n\nFirst of all, the place is in a somewhat dingy plaza.  Don&#x27;t be fooled, though.  Inside, Mama Maria&#x27;s is a cute, clean little mom &#x27;n pop type of place.  The server greeted us right away and brought us tortillas and salsa.  I say tortillas because they really are tortillas, not chips.  The salsa is, quite frankly, the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Having lived in west Texas for a couple of years, I have tried a LOOOOOOT of salsas.  I can say that this is the best I have personally experienced.\n\nThe beans and rice here are fab.  I got the tampiquena.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned.  I was impressed with the cheese enchilada - I normally find enchiladas (especially cheese ones) really boring, but this one wasn&#x27;t.  It was flavorful and gooey.  \n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying a few new things on the menu.  This strikes me as the kind of place you can try new things and just trust that they will be good.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place has both a restaurant and bakery and it&#x27;s right next to La Flor De Michoacan..Yes!!!  We tried their Menudo and their Chilaquiles with a fried egg as a topper.  The Chilaquiles were a good size portion and incredibly delish served with refried beans and rice!  The Menudo was so so, I certainly have had better but it was big enough to share but no fresh tortillas.  Their chips and salsa were also uniquely different and so delicious.  The salsa had no spice (yay) but plenty of flavor and the chips were whole round tostadas freshly fried to a thin hot crisp. 3\n\nThe place is small and a little corny with their décor but the food and service make up for it!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Finally! I made it! I could just kick myself for waiting so long to try mama marias, especially since its down the street for my house! This place is legit. The food is good the prices are cheap and the people are friendly. It&#x27;s a small spot nothing fancy, maybe a little old and worn on the inside, but the food makes up for all of that. My friend and I shared this Mexican platter meal, it was $20 and it included one cheese enchilada, one chile rellano, a piece of carne asada, a small chimichanga and rice and beans of course. Seriously where else can you get all of that for $20?? And I never like chile rellano&#x27;s but this one was delicous!! Plus they give you fresh tostadas and salsa that were really yummy too. I am definitley returning and adding a margarita next time!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The salsa is what you come for, the food is what you stay for. The salsa is hands down the best in Las Vegas. It is fresh with chopped onions and herbs waiting to be scooped up. I could drink this stuff. It could be served as a soup on its own. It is so good. The bean dip is a great pairing to it, but really the red stuff is all you need. I mean with all the veggies, could one live on salsa alone? If yes, this is the stuff you want to choose. The menu options are wide and offer a group plenty of choices. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a meal selection here. Plus, there is a bakery connected to it so you can get your concha fix as well.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Mama Maria&#x27;s Mexican restaurant was a fun place for me to try because it&#x27;s decently close to where I live. My family and I ordered for takeout, which was very convenient. One thing to note is that we participate in the season of Lent, so we had to avoid beef and poultry. Seafood and eggs are fine for us to have eaten.\n\nI commend this restaurant on really good service. They had a busy restaurant, but were able to have our takeout order ready on time and neatly packed, which was much appreciated.\n\nWe ordered guacamole, Chilles Relleno, garlic butter shrimp, shrimp fajitas, and crispy shrimp tacos.\n\nOur order came with chips and salsa! Like everybody has pointed out, the chips come in the form of freshly fried tortillas that you break into tinier pieces. The salsa was delicious! The tomato sauce in it interestingly had a \&quot;pasta sauce\&quot; flavor, which for me, set it apart from any other Mexican salsa I&#x27;ve ever tried. They sent us home with a bunch too, so I was very happy!\n\nWe also ate the chips with the guacamole we ordered. It was good and fresh guac, but it seemed plain for my taste.\n\nWe didn&#x27;t care for the shrimp fajitas or the butter garlic shrimp too much, not very special. The crispy shrimp tacos were a big bust in my opinion because I expected deep fried, breaded shrimp and I thought that was what the menu meant when they said \&quot;crispy\&quot;, but apparently that description was only referring to the taco shell, which I cancelled out when I asked to have my tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla instead. Furthermore, nothing had sour cream or crema, which was odd to me. I guess I just didn&#x27;t realize I had to order it separately.\n\nThe Chilles Relleno was SUPERB. My dad and I were so impressed by how tasty this dish came out! If you ever visit this restaurant, that is certainly the dish to try. It was spongy from the egg, but also satisfyingly saucy at the same time. There was a lot of good flavor to it, too. The portion size was another thing I was happy with also.\n\nOverall, I wouldn&#x27;t look forward to ordering anything but the Chilles Relleno. That&#x27;s the thing to try, hands down.&quot;,

It was almost ready when I went in.  \n\nI was impressed with the size and the ingredients. I also loved how they packaged everything up so well.  I feel the food was inviting, and I would order to go again, and also stop in to eat if I was in the area. \n\nThe giant burrito is enough for two people or two large meals throughout the day for sure.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Two things that I&#x27;m a big fan of here are the delicious salsa which they serve with fresh warm tortilla chips and the desserts. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any dessert you choose. The churros are warm and have a delicious cinnamon filling, and come with ice cream. The fried ice cream is just as good. \n\nThe service is good. They always play good spanish music too. \n\nThe food, in my opinion is alright. Good but not amazing. I&#x27;ve tried different things. The mole was not good at all, I&#x27;m sorry. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again. But perhaps my taste buds just don&#x27;t like mole. \n\nThe burritos are decent. I&#x27;ve had the giant burrito. It is indeed... giant. They serve their burritos enchilada style, meaning smothered in sauce. \n\nThe chips and salsa, convenient location and friendly staff keep me coming. I plan to try more on their menu and hopefully I find something I love, cos I really want to love this place.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I love the cheese enchiladas and the guacamole and the warm, huge chips and the spicy salsa and the perfect mole sauce and the cold Coronas and the creamy flan and the nice servers and the kitschy decor.  MM&#x27;s is inexpensive, yummy, and friendly.  It&#x27;s connected to a bakery so you get the fragrance of all of that good stuff, as well.  Win!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ate at Mama Maria&#x27;s on 9-17-2013.  It&#x27;s located on (6055) East Lake Mead and sets in a little strip mall on the south side of the road.  I would label this restaurant as a Mom &amp; Pop type place. It&#x27;s small, clean, and the wait staff is very accommodating.  The decor is a little dated with murals on the walls and christmas type lights strung across the ceiling.  I was hungry for refried beans and rice and my waiter Christian, suggested a dish with shredded beef, and my plate had a large portion of refried beans and rice as what I was hungry for.  I was served (immediately with)  salsa and fresh warm (4 flat) tortilla like \&quot;chips\&quot; that were good. The shredded beef was good and not overly seasoned, as was the rest of the meal.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t drive across town just to eat at Mama Maria&#x27;s but if I was in the area, I would defiinetly eat there when I was hungry for Mexican Food.  My order came to just under $9 with free refill on my drink order as I had ordered extra beans and rice, I felt the price was reasonable and the food was satisfying.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We took the 14 . 7 mile drive from the south end of the strip to this restaurant because of the good yelp reviews, we were a little surprised to find it is actually a small 8-9 table restaurant attached to a Panadaria (bakery ), but it looked nice enough and so we went on in, there were only a couple other patrons, and our waitress quickly cleaned off a table for us and we sat down, she soon returned with chips and salsa. The basket of chips was actually 5 whole deep fried corn tortillas and the salsa was very tasty, medium to spicy with fresh cilantro. Within a short 5-7 minute wait our plates arrived. I had the chicken burrito enchilada style with verde sauce. It was garnished with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. The burro was good sized, the chicken was large pieces of white meat and fairly flavorful, the burro also had refried beans and overall was decent, but kinda dry. My meal was certainly not bad, and the chili verde sauce was homemade and above average. But the entire plate came to the table only warm, not hot like many times is the custom with Mexican food dishes, where the server has to use a hot pad to bring it, within a couple minutes it seemed cold. I inquired about the quality of the other meal and the report was about the same as mine, the food was barely warm, the sauce above average but the  shredded beef was the canned variety and while acceptable certainly not like slow roasted, simmered in spices and cooked to perfection! Overall we rate this place 4  stars. The service was good, our server appeared to be working the dining room alone and was efficient and attentive. The salsa fresh and flavorful. The sauces above average. Probably a very nice neighborhood restaurant, driving here from the strip, we probably passed by quite a few better Mexican food options and probably won&#x27;t be back, but we will make a stop at Luv-It frozen custard and cleanse our palates with a delicious frozen treat! Adios Maria!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is the first time I went to Mama Maria&#x27;s but it won&#x27;t be my last.  I enjoy Mexican food and this place is legit.  The only complaint I really have is the chips are not really chips, but tostadas.  The salsa was good, not heavy on the tomatoes and they don&#x27;t give you a bean dip.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the food.  Really, it prevents you from going heavy on the tostadas and spoiling your appetite.\n\nI had the chicken enchiladas and they serve three nicely sized enchiladas for a reasonable price; they were \&quot;money!\&quot;  In other words, they tasted really good and I&#x27;m picky when it comes to Mexican food.  I dined with some of my co-workers and they all enjoyed their food.  For the people that order the Burrito, it is huge!!!\n\nThe only draw-back is the side of town it is on, but the strip mall where it&#x27;s located didn&#x27;t seem shady.  The restaurant is next door to a Mexican bakery. \n\nI really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this place.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My mom and I ate here.  I have been wanting some authentic Mexican food for awhile so when my mom came to visit I decided to come here and give it a try since it had so many stars and great reviews.  And it showed.  The food was soooooo good!! I HAVE to eat here one more time before I move.. They serve homemade fresh tostada chips with salsa that is delicious.  And their rice is made from scratch you can tell. Everything was super good.  You can taste the authenticity for sure.  It tastes as if you are at your abuelita&#x27;s house eating some home cooked food.  Love it... \n\nNext door is a pastry shop with pan Dulce&#x27;s.  Mmmmm we got some to go and let me tell you even a couple of days later the pan dulce still tastes fresh..&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Along with the fact that I&#x27;ve had a bad experience here before with the waitress and the problem of the sewage smell coming through the door upon walking in, I am absolutely appalled by the service that I received today by waitress named Gloria. I received very bad service from her before but because the food here is decent I figured I would give her another chance and thought that she just had a bad day. Upon walking in, I sit down and she takes my order and does not even ask me if I want anything to drink (let alone even offer the option for chips and salsa). She immediately sits down and gets on her phone and starts chatting and laughing and I asked her if I can get some water along with having the free salsa and chips that is normally offered. She told me that they charged for the second round of chips and salsa and the first one is free if you eat in the restaurant. She assumed that I was going to take the food to go which puzzled me as to why she never even asked in the first place whether or not I was going to take the food and immediately took it upon herself to charge me. Already feeling irritated with her service, I asked for her manager and she gave me the name of her manager along with the days that he worked. She also stated her name to me in a very rude way and then turned around to complete what she was doing in the kitchen along with canceling my order.\n\nThe reason why I come to this place is because the food is good and they&#x27;re close to my area of residence yet because of that, it still does not give anyone a reason to treat their customers with a lack of service. I&#x27;ve spoken to the manager before and he seems like a very nice guy who would rectify the situation but I&#x27;m just hoping that in the future management would be more aware of how  their waitresses treat their customers. \n\nBeing in Las Vegas there are SO many Mexican restaurants in the city I believe it would behoove any Mexican restaurant owner or business to make sure that they are a cut above the rest due to the high competition. \n\nThe only reason why I gave them two stars is because the food is decent, although the last time when she brought the chips out they were oily and cold. I asked Ms Gloria to reheat them and this is where the attitude started with me. I&#x27;ve been eating there in the past two years and never have I had any issues with the service. \n\nIn this case, Ms. Gloria you really left a bad taste in my mouth and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Really decent authentic Mexican food. There are limited tables/seating, but we came on a Saturday night and had no issues as a party of 5. \n\nTwo orders of chili verde, one tampequena, one enchiladas verde and last but not least, wings and fries for T. Oh, and a large order of guac to share. The tostadas and salsa were good, I liked that they were thin like tortilla chips. The guac was ok. I like mine to be a bit on the chunky side. This one was more smooth but still had good flavor. We usually finish the bowl but didn&#x27;t here. Our food arrived shortly after and it looked great. I asked for no sour cream or cheese and corn tortillas with my chili verde and it arrived with cheese and zero tortillas. The other order of chili verde didn&#x27;t receive the flour tortillas either. I made due and ate around the cheese- the beans and rice were delicious, as was the chili verde. It had awesome flavor and spice. The fries and wings were sub-par but it&#x27;s not really a place known for that, so I let it slide a bit. The enchiladas verde and tampequena got great reviews from the others.\n\nI wouldn&#x27;t mind coming back if we are on the Eastside and in the mood, but I will not drive out of my way for it.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The restaurant is small, probably room for about 50.  I went Saturday at lunch and it was busy, and there was a steady flow of customers.  The problem was there was only one waitress.  She was efficient, but obviously the service wasn&#x27;t as good as it should be.  The family had carnitas, minichangas, and a chimichanga.  All were very tasty, and the price was very fair.  Because there was only one server, the later guests had to clean their own tables.  I also used the bathroom after eating, and it was about as clean as a gas station bathroom.  Must be something close to authentic as we were the only gringos in the place.  I&#x27;d give the food five stars, but service and cleanliness need to be improved.&quot;,

A friend was visiting from Hawaii where they have no Mexican restaurants and was craving some so we tried this place and it was awesome! Kind of a small place, not really made for big groups but still awesome. We got the enchiladas verde and enchiladas Guadalajara and both a chicken and beef tamale. Extremely delicious. And the MICHELADA WAS PERFECT. Both of them lol I don&#x27;t get to east side often but I would definitely recommend this place!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I tried Maria&#x27;s with a group from work after hearing a recommendation from a friend.  I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nWe started with tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole, and I followed that with the Green Enchiladas.  Everything was served hot and fresh and I was very content after the meal.  My colleagues had the Cameron&#x27;s a la Diabla and the Taco Plate.  Everything looked great and there weren&#x27;t any complaints.  The restaurant has an at-home feel, amplified by having a connected and associated bakery right next door.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a store front, so parking might get tight now and then.  We went at lunchtime and the lot was fairly full.\n\nI&#x27;m not on the northeast side of town much these days, but when I am I&#x27;ll definitely grab lunch here again.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;If you are willing to drive distances to try out a great hole in the wall, then put Mama Maria&#x27;s on your list of places to try. Someone told me about this place a few weeks ago and have been wanting to go since. We finally made the trip way out to the Northeast and were rewarded with fantastic food, reasonable prices, and friendly service. \n\nAfter debating between several items, we decided to order the chile verde, enchiladas verdes, and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce, and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks, but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega&#x27;s cafe, which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce, this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg, and there wasn&#x27;t a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein, less fat, and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I&#x27;ve had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish, but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork, because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren&#x27;t broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven&#x27;t separated from one another), and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking, the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I&#x27;ve had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond, VA), but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all, because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks, the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus, it was the perfect size. If you don&#x27;t want to try the desserts here, however, you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles, which are also inexpensive.\n\nThough I&#x27;ve only been once, it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it&#x27;s run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking, just like at Vega&#x27;s cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets, a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus, it&#x27;s always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;México lindo y querido, si muero lejos de ti, que mi última cena sea aquí.\n\nTranslation: Beautiful and beloved Mexico, if I die far from you, let my last meal be here.\n\nSeriously, that&#x27;s how I felt when I had lunch here a few days ago.  And I *know* authentic, good Mexican food; I grew up in West Texas minutes from the border with Mexico, my mother is full-blooded Mexican, and I was actually born in Mexico.  \n\nI drove across the city (literally across the city, this place is on Lake Mead and Mt Hood and I drove from Sahara and 215) just to try this place out.  Full disclosure: I went to college with the current owner (the parents are the ones that opened this place up years ago).\n\nI&#x27;d been looking for a place that served good menudo, and I&#x27;d asked friends of mine and I was directed here.  Hmm ok, regardless if I know you or not, I am going to let you know my honest opinion on it, and if it sucks, it sucks, friendship be damned.  \n\nIt doesn&#x27;t suck at all.  The menudo is so good!  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily in the least, the chile is just the right level of caliente, the hominy is tender, and the tripe is clean and not-chewy.  And it&#x27;s served with dried oregano, lime, chopped onions, chile flakes, and cilantro, so you can garnish at your preference.  A little oregano, a few onions, and some lime juice and my menudo was ready to go.  So, so good!  And probably would have cured any hangover.  \n\nBut I get ahead of myself.  This place is very much a hole-in-the-wall, cozy like your abuela&#x27;s kitchen type place.  Maybe not your abuela but like mine for sure.  There&#x27;s no pretentiousness at all, and my friend and I were welcomed to take a seat where we liked.  After being seated, drink orders were taken (just water thanks!), and then homemade chips (really they&#x27;re fried tortillas that you break) and homemade red salsa (happy medium between chunky and smooth).  \n\nSo my friend is more reserved and orders the chicken taquitos as an appetizer (while I had my super-tasty menudo) which she enjoyed.  I had one with some guacomole and the guacamole was fresh.  She then ordered a chicken taco plate, which she thoroughly enjoyed, though I can&#x27;t judge because I was preoccupied with my meal.\n\nI ordered chile verde.  Super tender pork simmering in a green sauce (tomatillo base) for hours, served with a side of yellow rice and refried beans.  The sauce... so, so good.  Now the chips and salsa and the menudo had me pretty full and I was sure that I would only be able to take a few bites of the chile verde and the rest would have to go in a take-home container.  No, no, the chile verde sauce said no, you will enjoy every last tasty morsel here... and it was right. \n\nThe server was very attentive and my water glass was never empty.  The music in the background was mariachi and norteno, so yes, it supported the authenticity.  Price-wise, unbelievably reasonable for the meal my friend and I had here.  \n\nNow, I traveled across the city already for some tasty, authentic Mexican food, and I was not leaving without some tasty, authentic Mexican pastries.  To the panadería next door!  I take a half-dozen with me for a very reasonable price and I&#x27;ve been enjoying them at home since my visit.  I&#x27;m down to my last pineapple empanada, so I may have to trek across the city sooner than later.  \n\nIf you want truly authentic Mexican food full of flavor at very reasonable prices and served by friendly people, go here.  And go again.  I will be for sure!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Oh? Another patbingsu review? This one was better than the one I had two years ago. That&#x27;s for sure. They&#x27;re doing proper shaved ice now. The milky kind. We got the green tea one today for $8.80 plus tax, and while it wasn&#x27;t very big, especially shared between three people, it was quite tasty. They put the matcha powder in with the milk mix, so the shaved ice was actually matcha flavored. They then put a good amount of red beans and condensed milk on top, then added a few bits of mochi. Without the condensed milk, it could have been a bit sweeter, but with it, it was just about right. While this isn&#x27;t going to be my go-to patbingsu place, I&#x27;m still thankful for a place close to home where I can get my shaved ice cravings satisfied.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;What really earns them their 5 stars is the unique variety of baked goods you&#x27;ll find here! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, other than the variety, the buns themselves are good! Or at least all the ones I have tried lol. \n\nI was skeptical about cheese with red bean but it turned out to be a rather good combination. It&#x27;s cream cheese so it is a sweet and salty bun. \n\nI love the sweet potato cream bun. Sweet potato flavor is subtle and the bun is really really soft. They have a green tea and regular cream version too. \n\nI tried the peanut crunch one and my bf was a big fan but I felt like it wasn&#x27;t quite crunchy enough so it came off as a stale sort of crispy to me. The cream in the middle is just regular white cream, not flavored. I&#x27;m not a fan of it but it wasn&#x27;t bad overall. \n\nWould definitely go back to try a few other things! Worth a visit!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Located inside the Galleria Supermarket.\nStopped by on a Thursday evening and bought the green tea sweet potato cake.\nInteresting flavour combo - potatoes in a slice of cake. The bitterness of the green tea balances well with the sweetness of the sponge cake. Pieces of sweet potato in the fluffy cream filling. If you&#x27;re in the area, it&#x27;s a nice option to pick up dessert after dinner!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;One of my favorite bakeries! This bakery is inside Galleria Supermarket but is a store of its own. Everyday they offer a huge selection of buns. Although this location has less selection than the store at Yonge and Steeles.\n\nBut when it comes to flavor and quality of the goods, both locations are EXCELLENT!\n\nI have tried the sausage donut ($2), the sugar twist donut ($1.80), the cream cheese bun ($2) and the red bean and cream cheese bun ($2). I recommend all of them and I think that whichever bun you choose you will not be disappointed. This bakery has better-tasting buns than a typical chinese bakery.\n\nIf you choose one of the cream-filled donuts/buns you will find that they are packed with cream and very sweet!\n\nThey do not accept the Galleria points card, by the way.\n\n\n\nReview 5 of 100&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place got some serious cakes. Tastes on par with Bakery Nakamura, in my honest opinion. \n\nMy wife and I got the 27 inch Sweet Potatoes Cake. The cake is light, fluffy, not too sweet and they use real sweet potatoes.  I wanted to eat the whole cake but my wife got a hold of myself. Just look at it. They designed it pretty cute too.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My first patbingsu!\n\nBakery Gateau is located inside of Galleria (as in the Korean supermarket). It is its own store though, and has its own store listing.\n\nI&#x27;ve been waiting a year to try patbingsu here (yeah. One too many k-dramas). They only have it in the summer (seasonal). Patbingsu is shaved ice topped with things like red bean, fruit, condensed milk, etc. Bakery Gateau&#x27;s comes in three different types (red bean - $7.50, fresh fruit - $8.00, and green tea - $8.00). Yeah. For something I&#x27;d like to call a big, glorified, Asian snow cone, it&#x27;s quite expensive. \n\nI ordered the red bean one (I should have ordered green tea, but I didn&#x27;t read the menu correctly). I&#x27;m not a fan of red bean. After tax, it was about $8.50. It serves about two. The ice is shaved to order. It is then topped with condensed milk (and/or evaporated milk. She put two milky substances in there), red bean paste (lots of it), a few spoonfuls of canned fruit, a few fresh blueberries and a few fresh strawberry quarters (washed and cut to order). The red bean paste was quite chunky. It&#x27;s darker colored than its Chinese counterpart. It&#x27;s also considerably thicker. It&#x27;s more bean paste and less bean sauce. What I mean is that this was more of a chunky mashed potato consistency, whereas the Chinese version on shaved ice is usually more whole or half beans in a syrupy consistency. It was slightly difficult to mix together. Taste-wise, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite thing in the world, but it was definitely not as unpleasant as I thought it was going to be (much less red bean regret than I thought). It was very refreshing. \n\nMaybe I&#x27;ll come again for their green tea one....if I can wrap my head around the price.&quot;,

I had their Sweet Potato Cakes last time which was a bomb!!!  I like the react that their cakes are not too sweet, fluffy and tasty.  Moreover, I went with 16\&quot; Tiramisu which the staff suggested is one of their popular cakes. They are absolutely right and I can see why it is popular. Simply delicious!&quot;,

Service (the little I experienced, since it was just placing and picking up an order) was comfortable and nice.\n\nBonus points for being open all days of the week (so many other bakeries are closed on Monday/Sunday/other random times).&quot;,

All very exclusive pieces and made from great craftsmanship traditions.\n\nYes. It&#x27;s pricey. But you actually get what you pay for. \n\nFirst off, even a savvy online buyer will have a hard time finding some of the brands and pieces they have in store. \n\nSecondly, all the items are specially curated to match the season and rise a bit more above the mainstream contemporary wear of the day.  \n\nThirdly, the service.  You aren&#x27;t getting some schmuck who just read hypebeast or blogged about Pitti Uomo a few weeks ago after staring at Instagram pics for an hour.  The staff are actually passionate about their craft. They are also genuinely friendly and as far as what I&#x27;ve seen, not pushy at all. It&#x27;s a rarity in any big city and an even bigger rarity in Yorkville.\n\nTake this into consideration when you &#x27;re dropping serious coin for a pair of jeans: you&#x27;re going to hopefully invest in a nice set of garments, you want to look cool and somewhat &#x27;exclusive&#x27; or unique without being a diddling twat, and you don&#x27;t want to get robbed or made to feel like an idiot why purchasing. If you want all of that, spend the extra couple of dollars and do it right.\n\nIf you&#x27;re on a budget, no worries, sales are seasonal and a lot of cool stuff actually comes off the racks at great prices. That being said, don&#x27;t wait around like a jackal for a deal...chances of that happening to a piece you&#x27;ve been eyeing for a while aren&#x27;t great.\n\nHonestly, go and buy clothes here. Looks nice, feel good and speak to sales people who actually give a shit about you as a customer and as a person.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;First of all, there&#x27;s the clothes. A carefully curated selection of cool clothes that have just enough edge to set them apart from the crowd, while still being subtle, classic, and tasteful. You&#x27;ll find everything here from sweet jackets and shirts, to awesome accessories like watches, hats, and socks. \n\nThen there&#x27;s the customer service. All I can say is wow. I recently ordered some clothes from their website and promptly received an email from Donnell at the store to let me know that one of the items I ordered sizes a bit large and that they usually suggest going a size down. Incredibly, he also offered to personally drop the order off since it was a large order. You just don&#x27;t see this kind of customer service anymore. There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;ve been in business for over twenty years; they know clothes and they know how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer has a great experience shopping with them.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Uncle Otis has been a purveyor of menswear going on 25 years strong, which solidifies OG status for the minimalistic retail space that is tucked away along Bellair in the posh Yorkville area. The focus has recently shifted towards a more contemporary mens look than the streetwear aesthetic which was formerly the emphasis of the shop.\n\nThe majority of the sales floor is dedicated to casual but stylish gear that is either slightly industrial or military influenced in its appeal. Major brands from around the world including Japan can be found alongside a healthy dose of locally made stock. Accessories ranging from backpacks to leather goods make up a significant portion of the products on display.\n\nEverything about this place draws me in, from the excellent customer service to the nicely done decor. Garments are put at the forefront of all the visual merchandising, giving you a chance to imagine what wearing these threads might look like before you purchase them. It&#x27;s spacious in here, and these guys are definitely experts when it comes to what they sell. Now that I&#x27;ve been acquainted, I&#x27;ll be sure to drop in to look for those staple pieces that define one&#x27;s wardrobe.&quot;,

The prices may seem high, but you get what you pay for and they decent sales once in a while.\n\nThe staff is especially friendly, down to earth, helpful and very knowledgable. \nThey give great opinion and advice, especially when it comes to fit. Also they will give washing and care instructions to each piece of clothing you purchase, which I though was thoughtful and shows the pride in their inventory.\n\nThey have a very nicely designed store and doesn&#x27;t feel stuffy or pretentious as other stores in the area.\n\nSome of the European lines do run rather large in sizing, but most of their staples like their jeans has sizes that will fit most.\nI prefer to get my jeans and pants here over Over the Rainbow, which I don&#x27;t particularily enjoy shopping there.&quot;,

I decided to go ahead and have them repair the bumper. After a week of my car being in the shop, I picked up my car and let me tell you... you couldn&#x27;t even tell my car had been damaged at all. The bumper looked good as new! The staff here are very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and they do an amazing job. From my experience, I would definitely recommend bringing your car here for repairs.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I had a new Escalade that somebody wrecked. I was referred to take it to AW. It took two months to fix with a number of excuses why it was taking so long. I was even told one time it was because of the insurance adjuster, I called the adjuster and it was not true. Now after two months I get a call that is done and I can come pick it up. I leave work and drive across town to pick it up and guess what, it was not even done. They missed the A pillar damage, what? So they will me to come the next day. I get a call the next day and they tell me to wait one more day as they wanted it to be perfect for me. So finally I go get it. There are pieces of garbage in the paint so big I can catch a nail on them. I took it home over the weekend so I could inspect it. I put blue tape on each piece of junk, run, HAIR and sag and there was probably 50 to 60 pieces of tape all over the repairs. Monday morning I called them and asked to talk to the manager. He asked me to meet him Tuesday morning at 8 am. I drive there and he is late so the painter comes out to look at it. I proceed to tell him all the tape all over the truck are flaws in the paint, he proceeds to argue with me over it and saying one of the scratches in the paint is from being washed, I never washed it. Finally the manager shows up and barely says a word but they will take care of it. So again two more days to fix it. HAHA, again they did crappy work. All they did was buff the hell out of it so now the new paint work is glass smooth and all the original factory paint work has its usual orange peel in it. When I pointed it out they stand there saying nothing. That kinda told me they are use to being called out on their poor work. I highly DO NOT recommend them. Take your car to Exotic and get a good job done. This place is a disaster.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I had a great experience with AW Collision. This was my second time using their services. First time (about 4 years ago)  I had an accident in my Volvo C30 (not my fault lol), and the repairs were flawless like nothing happened. Their customer service and communication back then was so good that I decided to use them again this time around for my Mini Cooper. There was debris on the freeway and I could not avoid it and it did a lot of damage to the bumper and fender. I bought the mini in Portland from a dealership almost 3 years ago. That dealership lied to me when I asked them if it had prior damage/ accidents and they said no. One month later in this hot and dry climate my paint started cracking on the hood and progressively spread and got worse because there was damage and they did a Mickey Mouse job on repairing it. So I figured I&#x27;ll just get that repaired as well while my car was there already to get that other damage repaired. Once again it looks flawless and better than new. The customer service from everyone there  is great, they explained everything in detail to me. From what they were going to repair, to why my paint had cracked, to the quality products that they use and why. You get a lifetime guarantee as well which makes me happy and confident that they stand by their work. I&#x27;ve had two separate great experiences and I will refer people and use them again myself (hopefully not anytime soon lol). I brought my car in kinda dirty and when I picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out! That too made me super happy because I was planning to get and nice car wash after I picked it up and now I did not have to. Thanks so much you guys a big thumbs up to you all!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I was recently caught in a stone storm (pea gravel) and I contacted my auto insurance company to remain nameless to protect the innocent. I received the names of three local body shops which I reviewed and found lacking. I contacted my vehicle dealership and was told they only use A W Collision and I went there. I called the shop and talked with Tom and agreed to come in on Saturday morning for him to see the vehicle and give my insurance information. Tom called them and started the process, because the color is a pearly white the damage is hard to see from three feet away.  Tom had his ace guy mark up the vehicle for the insurance adjuster to view the car. Tom is the reason I chose AW rather than the Kmart of body shops my insurance company wanted me to use with lifetime guarantees.  If you have a need for body work go to A W Collision you will not be disappointed.&quot;,

Teresa was great to work with and wanted to make sure that I was satisfied with all of my repairs. Even tough I have my car back, Teresa is still working with the other person\&quot;&#x27;s insurance company to work through the repairs and the costs associated with the rental car. Key Insurance was the other insurance carrier and has been a nightmare for Myself, Teresa, and my attorney, Adam McClausky, to work with. My husband has stage 4 cancer and they all made sure that there were no unnecessary trips or panic associated with the entire issue. Thank You Guys!!&quot;,

Each of their staff  are very clean, neat and well-spoken.  They each took the time to explain everything that would take place in my repair process and with my insurance company.  And they always answered every question.  After the initial inspection by my insurance company, THEY further inspected my damage, found further damage, and argued with my insurance company to cover the new-found damage.  They phoned me several times to keep be abreast of the timing of completion&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Diane went over a high curb right in front of our Redlands home and the left side of the front bumper of our 2017 Cadillac XTS ripped slightly away.  Even though we could almost put the bumper back in its designated slots, it soon became evident that the bumper would flare out again even more at high freeway speeds--especially in windy conditions.  So I showed the damaged bumper to the service tech at Cadillac of Las Vegas, and he referred me to AW Collision, alerting me that repairs would probably cost over $2,000, because I likely needed a new front bumper.\n\nI quickly drove the vehicle to AW Collision, and was informed that if a new bumper was ordered, it would have to be repainted, because Cadillac bumpers just come in basic black color.  With a three-part painting process needed to blend in new paint with the car&#x27;s existing unusual deep amethyst metallic color, this sounded like a nightmare to me.  \n\nBut not to worry!  The exterior bumper sustained no visible damage--not even cosmetic.  Only an out of sight fastener had been ripped,.  And after a physical inspection estimator Theresa told me that a skilled technician on staff could repair the existing bumper with plastic soldering, and the car would look like new.  She was friendly and professional, and I was ultimately given a very reasonable written estimate for recommended repairs that totaled just under $500.\n\nI scheduled an appointment for service, left the car for just 2-1/2 days, and when I picked it up it had been washed with care and indeed looked just like new.  Since then, the repaired bumper has firmly held together in all kinds of driving conditions.  Based on this experience, if I need any future body work performed on this vehicle, I will not hesitate to trust those repairs to AW Collision.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Despite having beeping parking sensors, a rear view camera I still managed to reverse my car into a huge wall in a recent snow storm in Utah. Cadillac of las Vegas recommended AW Collision so here goes.\n\nIt is at the bottom of the W. Desert Inn so super convenient for most. Parking is good and as you walk into a very clean but basic waiting area, two leather sofas , a flat screen tv but little else. Bathrooms were clean but had no towels and there was no reading material other than an older brochure for Land Rover.\n\nThey quickly provide an estimate which was reasonable, and what I really liked was their willingness to order, prepare the replacement bumper prior to my appointment for repair. This meant rather than lose my car for three days , I simply showed up and waited an hour while they took off the crumpled bumper and replaced it while I waited about 90 minutes. Good.\n\nWork was good but on inspection I found the alignment of my bumper was out a little, they quickly took it back in the shop and it was readjusted. \n\nGood body shop I will use again but hopefully I won&#x27;t have to......&quot;,

Overall very happy with the repair, they were very helpful and the car looks like it did when I bought it, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this place to a friend.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Gosh this company is amazing ! I took my car here for a repair to the rear bumper of my Honda Accord 16 when someone rear ended . I was referred here from the Honda dealership so I had high expectations. I believe it was Wendy who was doing my paper work. She was super friendly, and helpful and was able to answer any questions I had. Tom was the one who took care of my case and was very thorough and explained everything to me about the damage from my car. If it had not been because of the opposing insurance taking forever I probably would have gotten my car back in two or three days ! That&#x27;s how fast they were once the quote got approved. When I came to pick up my car they completely detailed the car and the car looked even better then when I picked it up the first day I bought it. My husband even asked if it&#x27;s the same car lol ! Thanks you so much aw collision! Highly highly recommend !&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;5-11-17 updated review. It&#x27;s. It letting me leave another one. The team at AW Collision has done it again! My passenger side mirror in my Mini Cooper needed to be replaced and repainted because I hit a construction cone. I took it to Ozzie and Tonya and they went above and beyond and my new mirror cap repainted. It matches absolutely perfect and looks like nothing aver happened. Thank you guys so much for doing excellent work and having such great customer service. I will refer anybody to you if they ever need any body work. \n\n\nI had a great experience with AW Collision. This was my second time using their services. First time (about 4 years ago)  I had an accident in my Volvo C30 (not my fault lol), and the repairs were flawless like nothing happened. Their customer service and communication back then was so good that I decided to use them again this time around for my Mini Cooper. There was debris on the freeway and I could not avoid it and it did a lot of damage to the bumper and fender. I bought the mini in Portland from a dealership almost 3 years ago. That dealership lied to me when I asked them if it had prior damage/ accidents and they said no. 6 months later in this hot and dry climate my paint started cracking on the hood and progressively spread and got worse because there was damage and they did a Mickey Mouse job on repairing it. So I figured I&#x27;ll just get that repaired as well while my car was there already to get that other damage repaired. Once again it looks flawless and better than new. The customer service from everyone there  is great, they explained everything in detail to me. From what they were going to repair, to why my paint had cracked, to the quality products that they use and why. You get a lifetime guarantee as well which makes me happy and confident that they stand by their work. I&#x27;ve had two separate great experiences and I will refer people and use them again myself (hopefully not anytime soon lol). I brought my car in kinda dirty and when I picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out! That too made me super happy because I was planning to get and nice car wash after I picked it up and now I did not have to. Thanks so much you guys a big thumbs up to you all!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The first thing I want to stay about this place is that this is where car dealerships take their cars to get detailed. So right there shows you&#x27;re in good hands. \n\nI was rear ended and then back of my car got super messed up. This place did such an amazing job fixing everything. Tanya Valencia, the manager and my new best friend, kept me updated with everything that was going on. When I was rear ended, the frame of the bumper got dented and pushed my frame in. $5100 worth of damage total! Tanya called me and emailed me pictures of everything that was going on. I was even able to swing by after they had taken the bumper off to take additional pictures for my lawyer. My car was in the shop for about 3 weeks total because they had to wait for parts from Kia. No complaints there, but I&#x27;m happy to say my car is back to factory condition. \n\nThis place is so awesome. I have a green Kia Soul, green tea latte to be exact. I&#x27;ve been told this is the hardest color to match when being painted but they did it perfectly. My car looks better than it did when I got it from the dealership!  They even cleaned it inside and out! \n\nTanya is incredible. When I had first came in to drop off my car, I told her what had happened with the accident I was in. She had gone through something similar and told me what she did about it and who she got for an attorney. She didn&#x27;t have to do that, but it made me happy she went the extra mile and gave me that advice. \n\nIf your car has a boo boo, you definitely need to take it here!!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please note this review is only on the acai bowls. After living in California for a decade acai bowls became the standard grab and go breakfast item. I&#x27;ve never been to Brazil but I feel I have my share of solid tasty acai bowls. Now to my assessment of of Bolt&#x27;s acai bowl. First I saw them pour a fruit mixture into a cup not blend a fresh array of fruit acai in a blender. Then they proceeded to top of this sludge with a pile fruit to bury this hot mess they called an acai bowl. It was liquid not frozen nor fresh and I definitely will not be going back for one at all. I give this 2 stars solely because they put a very tasty and better than the entire bowl, a coconut whip on top, that was the only good thing. If you&#x27;re going for the acai please stay away but if you&#x27;re having their salad bowls I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re ok as I have never tried them.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I came here with my BFF the first time, and it was overall a good experience. I customized my own salad, and the watermelonade that I got was good. My friend and I enjoyed our eats and then came back for the extravagant looking acai bowl. The acai bowl looks like it&#x27;s going to be the most incredible thing, but is really eye candy, because when you try it, you&#x27;re like this is alright, but can&#x27;t help but be a little disappointed because it looks like it&#x27;s going to be this wonderful explosion of flavour in your mouth. \n\nI came back the next day for the Beet juice, because i tried my friends and really liked it. Later on I came back for the Brazil something smoothie, which for $10, was really lacking. I make way better smoothies at home. On top of that, the girl who made my drink was wearing shorts that exposed her butt cheeks quite substantially, and I couldn&#x27;t believe she came into work like that and management didn&#x27;t do anything about it. It honestly turned me away from the place, because no respectful place would allow their workers to dress like that, unless you&#x27;re in a different industry. So, because I make the same juice myself at home, and my smoothies taste way better, and I don&#x27;t want to be exposed to random ass cheeks, I will not be back. Bolt management, I hope you&#x27;re reading this.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been to Bolt twice now.  It&#x27;s a good spot to grab a quick healthy bite.  The bowl servings are very generous.  Being a meat eater, I was still full after finishing my quinoa bowl.  The downside of this is the salsa mysteriously absorbed into my meal and left it seriously lacking taste.  I had the protein bowl the second time and the dressing + butternut squash give it more flavour - I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re not making your own.  Although, it still had a very \&quot;carby\&quot; feel to it I often get after eating vegetarian food.  I tried the beet juice which was tasty, but a smallish serving for the price.  The best part about bolt are the acai bowls.  I&#x27;ve had both on the menu, and they are like a healthy dessert, although I question how many calories they have.  That&#x27;s how good they are!\n\nBottom line is a decent, convenient spot to grab a very healthy, quick meal.  Think IQ/Kupfert/freshii but not limited to food court hours (aka no weekends).&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In the time of the 2016 Rio Olympics, big ups to Usain Bolt and Bolt Fresh Bar! I haven&#x27;t seen the meme grace their social media channels yet, but in due time, I am sure. \n\nI really like Bolt. From the bright interior to the easy-to-read menu, it&#x27;s not as intimidating a place as one might think. Definitely take a gander at the menu before you go in though because with so much selection, it is hard to not just stand there, mouth agog, while you make your decision. In times of sickness, I have turned to Bolt for supped-up orange juices and health shots from Elxr Juice Lab. In times of health, any old smoothie will do. I especially like the Lemon Tart, which has a little bite to it from the hemp hearts, lemon zest and Royal dates. For the instagrammable showstopper, run don&#x27;t walk to order an acai parfait and don&#x27;t skimp on the whipped coconut cream. That&#x27;s like ordering nachos without guac; it simply isn&#x27;t done. \n\nThe price point kind of prevents Bolt from being a daily or weekly indulgence, like a latte or muffin from coffee shops down the street. But, you do feel like you&#x27;re getting what you pay from when you see all the fresh ingredients lined up in a salad box or being churned into a bright drink. \n\n\n#BOLT&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;YES! I have been waiting for a yelp page for BOLT to open up because I have been dying to review the newest addition to my neighbourhood&#x27;s food scene. Surprisingly, there are not a lot of healthy/vegetarian options in WQW so when BOLT opened it was like an angel came down from the heavens above and personally blessed us with this beautiful, special and fantastic local offering.\n\nI have inhaled everything I have ever gotten from BOLT, which almost always consists of a \&quot;my grain\&quot; bowl. My personal favourite is quinoa, kale, beets, carrots, tofu and avocados with the zesty green dressing. If you order this and do not love it then you need to stop trying to convince yourself that you like healthy food. This combination is perfection. Ingredients are always crisp and fresh and the staff is so nice and happy. There is nothing I dislike about this place. They&#x27;re local, support local food, support local companies, and are focused on health and nutrition. It&#x27;s a fantastic spot and I&#x27;m so glad it opened up just down the street from me. I have quickly become a regular. \n\nI haven&#x27;t tried the smoothies yet but I have my eyes on the Greena Colada and will make it happen sooner than later.\n\nIn conclusion, I love you BOLT. Will you marry me?&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Despite my harsh past review (which, I totally think is justified btw), I decided to give Bolt another go a few months ago when I had a craving for a freshly squeezed juice, and since then I have been a frequent customer. So there you go Bolt, you converted me, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re happy about it. Since then I have ordered the freshly squeezed juice, smoothies (different flavours, and not the one that I previously wrote about that I didn&#x27;t like, the Lemon something is really really good). And actually, I have developed a taste for the Acai bowls which I have fallen in love with and give me great joy. I even started making them at home (I got the acai smoothie packs they use and I had the other ingredients) along with coconut whipped cream, but something I still like to get them when I&#x27;m downtown for work on the weekend (its a 5 min. walk), and sit outside the restaurant). Last time I went I even shared the oatmeal from the acai bowl with a cute birdie who really enjoyed it (did you know birds like raw oats? now you do). This place is expensive, however, I think some things are justified and some things arent. I picked up a teenie tiny brownie (looked like a half a regular brownie), for $3, and half a chocolate bar for 6.50, lol. I don&#x27;t regret it, but it&#x27;s pricey. For what goes into the acai bowl, I think the price is justified because they use great ingredients. I really think that there&#x27;s something for everyone here, even if you aren&#x27;t vegan/gluten free/dairy free/refined sugar free, etc. Bonus points for everything being gluten free here as well. This place is truly unique and offers something different.&quot;,

The staff was extremely friendly and took the time to talk to us about their products. The Armenian Lentil soup was divine. Very hearty and flavourful. I&#x27;ll definitely be back to try their salads and smoothies! \n\nNote: Not a sit down restaurant.&quot;,

Finally, it was mentioned that they don&#x27;t accept the tap function when paying with a card as they should earn tips; the tap function elongates that. That is bold to say when you are a take out spot, with no seating and terrible service. I hated my experience so much that I didn&#x27;t post it in my blog as I didn&#x27;t want to impact tens of thousands of people from not going here. Bad. Bad. Bad.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Bolt is within walking distance of The Drake Hotel (which I adored) and is great if you need your fix of green smoothies and drinks. The staff here is super friendly and I didn&#x27;t get a chance to check out their solid food. What I appreciated most about BFB is their willingness to accommodate dietary needs including my allergens of coconut and almond. Might not seem like a big deal to note; however, many sites use coconut and/or almond milk and don&#x27;t offer alternatives.\n\nI was very open about it being my first time and they were so kind to walk me through their ordering process and give some insight. They also sell a particular brand of cold-pressed juices which had me craving for more as I left the city. The best one was the activated charcoal cold-pressed juice for those crazy nights you need to recover from.\n\nWhen I&#x27;m back in the neighbourhood I will definitely be swinging back!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3.5 stars. \n\nBolt has made some recent changes and additions to their menu. One of the major changes that they&#x27;ve made was add onion flatbread snadwiches (these are decent, but I find 2 pieces of this flatbread too much for me because it is very oniony). They have also switched the strawberries for raspberries on one of their acai bowls (sadface - I know it&#x27;s because strawberries are harder to access etc., but still sadface), and also related to the acai bowl they have changed the granola (no longer just oatmeal but also had some seeds in their, dislike...). They also recently started advertising that you can get the coconut whip to go - which is a cool and awesome option that I get sometimes. Overall, I&#x27;m not pleased w/ their changes, but am in favour of the many additions, which also include different cookies, salad and sandwich toppings, and refrigerated drinks.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Not too shabby! This place is pretty good for a quick, healthy bite to eat. I&#x27;ve tried most of the menu items now and I&#x27;d have to say the best are the Kale Caesar and the Energy Parfaits.. oh, and the soup is always really tasty too! The Kale Caesar dressing is quite possibly the best I&#x27;ve had and I love that they threw some chickpeas, avocado, tempeh and grape tomatoes in there to keep things interesting. The coconut whipped cream on the parfaits is super thick and creamy. My only &#x27;beef&#x27; with this place is that it&#x27;s pretty expensive. Also, there&#x27;s nowhere to sit and eat. There are a couple of high top tables that you can stand at while you chow down but a few bar stools would really go a long way. But hey, thanks for making high quality healthy grub easily accessible!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I love the concept of Bolt -- with their offerings of fresh, healthy smoothies, juices and meals -- and even their website, with its bright orange background and round, cheerful font makes me want to be happier and healthier.\n\nUnfortunately, the food didn&#x27;t make me so happy. I stopped in to try the Protein bowl, a brown rice bowl (somewhat similar to Fresh&#x27;s bowl offerings) with cherry tomatoes, marinated tofu, sprouts, beans, butternut squash, pepitas and carrot miso dressing. Everything is served to-go, so the components of the bowl were assembled in a takeout container and the dressing is served in a plastic cup within. For $9, the serving is generous -- possibly enough for two full meals, depending on your appetite. I found it to taste overwhelmingly of ginger, although I wasn&#x27;t quite sure why, and the sauce seemed to disappear completely and be absorbed into the components without adding any enhancement of flavour. The more I ate, the less I liked it, and I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to finish it even though I still felt hungry. \n\nOn the positive side, the space inside is beautiful, and staff were very friendly. In addition to their menu items they also seem to sell drinks like kombucha, coconut water and some sort of kefir, as well as Chocosol chocolate. There appeared to be a few high-top tables inside, but no chairs, so perhaps not an ideal place to sit and linger. It&#x27;s a bummer that there aren&#x27;t any seating options inside, as I feel somewhat strange eating all this healthy food while producing so much unnecessary waste.\n\nI might come back to try one of their juice or smoothie offerings, but I&#x27;ll skip the grain bowl next time and get my meal elsewhere.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Bottom line: Above average, slightly-pricey healthy lunch takeout joint\n\nWalking in Parkdale, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to take notice of Bolt.  It&#x27;s unassuming without much flashy signage.  I walked by a few times before deciding to give it a go because the first few times the whirring sounds made me think they exclusively served juices/smoothies. \n\nThe closest competition I can think of is iQ Foods which also has similar packaging and food offerings.\n\nBased on the tips here, I tried two grain bowls: 1) Quinoa Bowl and 2) Vitamin Sea Bowl.\n\nQuinoa Bowl ($10): \nThis bowl contains shredded kale, green onions, parsley, avocado, tomato salsa and cherry tomatoes on a bed of quinoa.  Lots of green popping out when you open the box.  Feels very salad-y and generally quite tasty.  If you like fresh shredded kale then this is for you.  However, while it was good, it didn&#x27;t have quite the flavour punch I was hoping for.\n\nVitamin Sea Bowl ($9):\nThe Vitamin Sea Bowl was an interesting mix of quinoa, seaweed, carrots, a slice of avocado, a mix of kimchi, red cabbage, sesame seeds and some kelp noodles. There&#x27;s a separate creamy lemon tahini sauce.  It&#x27;s an interesting mix of ingredients and certainly feels very light.  The tahini sauce was slightly tart from the lemon but is quite subdued in its flavour.  The kimchi really grew on me; I felt that it was a strange addition early on but the combination of foods really hits that savoury spot.\n\nThe servings are pretty decent, though within expectations given the price. Ingredients are very fresh too.  Would visit regularly.&quot;,

Maybe it&#x27;s Maybelline?)\n\nSHMANYWAYS, Bolt is straight to the point, offering healthy, wholesome to-go meals that are organic and gluten free. I grabbed a cold pressed Beet Juice, and let me just say, their Beet juice is my top 5 contender for Beet Juice&#x27;s I&#x27;ve consumed (Number 1 Beet Juice is that one time I worked some Hippie Music Festival in BC and after the night shift of watching teenagers OD&#x27;ing on MDMA, and getting schmitty-faced drunk, Mama needed a refreshing Beet Juice to cleanse her palette. That Beet juice was historical and I fantasize about it to this day) \n\nSO YEA, Bolt has a nice Beet Juice. But possibly not the best ever Beet Juice. I also got their vegan curry on Quinoa, it was hearty and a great filling portion, the curry could have done with a touch more seasoning and it was missing something in terms of flavor, but it hit the spot nonetheless. \n\nMy main bish and I initially came here because their Acai Bowl looked like a dish of the gods, it was so intricately beautiful in instagram photos on the official Bolt page that we though it must taste like the food of gods. But we were mistaken, looks were deceiving and the acai bowl (which actually comes in a cup? huh?) was pretty bland and our feelings can be summed as such ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nPoints for feeling REALLY healthy while eating the whole thing.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please note this review is only on the acai bowls. After living in California for a decade acai bowls became the standard grab and go breakfast item. I&#x27;ve never been to Brazil but I feel I have my share of solid tasty acai bowls. Now to my assessment of of Bolt&#x27;s acai bowl. First I saw them pour a fruit mixture into a cup not blend a fresh array of fruit acai in a blender. Then they proceeded to top of this sludge with a pile fruit to bury this hot mess they called an acai bowl. It was liquid not frozen nor fresh and I definitely will not be going back for one at all. I give this 2 stars solely because they put a very tasty and better than the entire bowl, a coconut whip on top, that was the only good thing. If you&#x27;re going for the acai please stay away but if you&#x27;re having their salad bowls I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re ok as I have never tried them.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Okay so Bolt is 100% hype and like 30% truth. Yes the vitamin c bowl is pretty good but honestly all of the smoothies are just okay and the other bowls and salads are also just okay. The most irksome thing though is the service, last time I was in I was unaware that the menu had been changed as it was still up where it has always been and I didn&#x27;t see the inconspicuous dry erase board, aka \&quot;the new menu\&quot; in the shadows next to the \&quot;old\&quot; menu, a guy behind the counter asked my order and I began to tell him as the girl working there screams -yes, she lookied me in the eyes and yelled at me, it was very odd, there was a new menu, \&quot;didn&#x27;t I notice the NEW MENU?!\&quot; yeah, it sucked.&quot;,

Used her fingers to scoop vegetables/fruits, no gloves, then exchanged money to complete the transaction. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS, she proceeded to prepare my order, touched the fruit with her hands, wiped them on her shirt and then took my money. GROSS! Can you imagine the filth that&#x27;s on her hands, touching the food that customers are about to consume?!\n\n\nDuring the summer, she wears these teeny short short spandex shorts (more like underwear) and half of her bottom hangs out, I AM STARING AT HER BARE AS*!! I think another reviewer commented on this. \nLet&#x27;s not forget that regardless of how tasty this food may be or how popular this place may be, this is a FOOD joint and certain practices are unacceptable.\n\nAnother thing with this place is that servers think they&#x27;re too cool to prepare your food. No smiles, barely any eye contact, as if I&#x27;m bothering them by being there?\n\nI&#x27;m tired of these \&quot;cool\&quot; places that are popping up, where attitude is on the menu.\n\nGet real. Be nice to customers. Otherwise, you won&#x27;t get any. And for god&#x27;s sake, wash your hands and at least try to wear clothes  that don&#x27;t expose your as*.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Super disappointing! Wanted to grab solo dinner and thought this looked healthy.  I was happy to see BOLT open around 8:30pm.  I decided to go with their soup of the day with cauliflower and turmeric, I think it was.  I decided to add nacho chips to make it more substantial.  The soup was great but the nachos were stale and ruined the meal for me. :( I could see the associate digging around so she probably gave me the remnants of the bag when she should have informed me that it wasn&#x27;t available instead.  \n\nThis experience inspired me to cook more for myself - yeesh!\n\nThe only positive I see is that there&#x27;s a ton of climate friendly options, which I always appreciate in a place...\n\nWill be a very very slow walk back to try a smoothie or a bowl.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I hate giving unfortunate reviews but I feel this one is more a warning as my experience might be a Your Mileage May Vary.  Im not sure what happened or if it was just an off day but the service here seemed genuinely irritated and frustrated at something.\n\nThis is a quick service take out spot.  Though there is some standing room to eat your meal, the rough service makes this spot really unwelcoming and uncomfortable.  I could not wait to get my food and just head back to my car to eat instead.  Like most spots out in W Queen St W, it&#x27;s a narrow older spot that has a lot of character.  It&#x27;s clean and functional ... nothing really to be knocking it.\n\nAbout the service, I should have taken the death stare upon opening the door as my first hint that I should have turned around.  The tone and physical stance were really more confrontational and it most of the room look at each other with hesitation.  He definitely did not care for anything and the throwing around of bowls, utensils, and everything was a bit alarming.  \n\nAs for the salad, the vinaigrette nearly made the salad inedible.  It was overly salty and acidic... and I didnt put on very much onto it either.  The vegetable offering is ok.  Cauliflower was super limp and rubbery but all other vegetables seem at least fresh.  3/5\n\nI dont think I&#x27;ll be returning.  Not sure what happened but from a service and food, there&#x27;s better and more relaxing options nearby.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t really jive with Bolt even before I was barfing my face off from drinking their juice. I ordered some green piña colada smoothie my first time and it wasn&#x27;t great. I kept it in my fridge for days afterwards until it developed a composting skin because I couldn&#x27;t justify throwing out a $9 juice I didn&#x27;t like.\nSecond time I order the beet and whatever else is in it juice. I am hit with the most violent food poisoning soon after. My body did not want whatever was dying inside that juice in me.\nI called the next day to let them know, and I was told I got sick from something else, even though it was the first thing I consumed in 14 hours...  And considering my barf looked exactly like the juice I just consumed. The red of the beets made my bathroom look like a horror movie, so at least I got a cool picture&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Paying $7.50 for fresh pressed juice is not for everyone. \n\nIf you asked me six years ago if I would add this to my usual routine, I would have laughed you out of the room. However, things change and I am a convert. Do I have time to go to the market regularly for fresh produce? Would I pay money to have someone else clean out my darn juicer? Basically, I&#x27;ve just deemed the health-giving goodness at Bolt worth the price tag. \n\nIn the warmer months, I&#x27;m all about their Green Pineapple juice and in the winter months they usually bring the heat with their vegan soups.&quot;,

This store is a lot cleaner and a little more \&quot;put together\&quot; but I hate how people dont know how to organize a line! Anyway, I basically super like this store!!\n\nSince I&#x27;m a fatty I&#x27;m always trying to find cute clothes... its a hit or miss. Since I pretty tattooed I like to normally wear solids. Here they have a shit ton of flowers, and patterns which are no bueno for me!! But I usually find 1 or 2 things I heart. Yesterday I got a teal colored dress and a cute belt I can put under my boobies (Sorry laymen terms, haha) and my son got a Tron toy. All these tresures for only 27$!!\n\nI like that they have a bigger selection of my man size 9 shoes here!! Alas, half are high heels (Fat girls in heels are a no no!! I dont care if youre a fatty and say you can rock them, you know you&#x27;re ass is too heavy to be supported on some damn heels!! Quit lying! HAHAHA) I usually find really cute flats and socks!\n\nThey have a pretty decent selection of kids clothes as well! My son is small, so hes in a 5t to a small (hes 5 going on 6) and I always find him some CUTE clothes!! If you know me, my son does not dress like a busted ass kid! I hate when I see moms all dressed up and theyre kids look like a hot ass mess!! My hito and I always looks hella sweet : )\n\nAll in all I like this Ross, I frequent all of them though! But since this one is right by my apartment I go here the most!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I never leave empty handed when I come to this particular Ross.\n\nToday was a special day compared to other visits. I came to try to find a cotton hoodie and had no luck, but I left with something better.\n\nI browsed the handbag section and was surprised to find a Fossil leather cross-body bag originally $128 for $69 with no flaws. Wow!!!\n\nWhat was awesome about this purchase was that I&#x27;ve been waiting for about 8 months to purchase this bag from Zappos and Fossil online and by the time I decided to buy, it was sold out. So this find was pretty amazing for me.\n\nThe cashiers were friendly and the store was nice, clean and well organized and this was simply an awesome experience for me.\n\nHooray for Ross at Boca Park!!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Browsing on my lunch I decided to check out the clothes section which I never really do often here.  I usually like their home stuff.  It seemed the clothing selection was very sparce. Like large empty spaces in between items.  Perhaps its because they just opened a new location just up the road?\n\nThere is always a lot of people here.  So much that they have the roped off zig zag where the line goes just like you were at an amusement park. LOL.  I honestly don&#x27;t get the hype as this is just an \&quot;on occasion\&quot; kind of store for me.  Maybe I am missing something? lol\n\nRoss has a little bit of everything (in case you haven&#x27;t been here-but really who hasn&#x27;t?).  They carry men/women/children clothes and shoes, perfume, jewelry, purses, and housewares.  Some of their items are name brand I believe to be outdated and/or discontinued.  \&quot;Dress for Less\&quot; is their logo which means everything is at a discounted price.  The tags say what the real price is along with the marked down price.  Wait a minute - that&#x27;s it!  Its TRICKERY of the mind!  That&#x27;s the hype.  I don&#x27;t know but it sure sways me to see something discounted. ;) \n\nRoss Stores are always a hit and miss with me.  This time I found a dress and two shirts (which is rare) and I bought some Kitchenaide bright yellow scissors.  Total was under $40.  Not too bad I must say.\n\nI think I might check out the new one down the way soon.  Doesn&#x27;t really make much sense that they are a few blocks away from each other however I&#x27;m betting the new one to be a much nicer one.  I will check it out and let you know....to be continued.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is a relatively good Ross location. They have an organized system with the line that they seem to have perfected, unlike many other Ross locations. The store is typically well stocked and the employees are friendly.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Well, seeing as I sport the bargain queen crown, I MUST share my love for Ross Dress for Less..... ALL locations..... I could make a day just driving to every location across town to see what little treasure I could unearth...... LOVE to go here..... certain locations know me by name and get worried about me if they haven&#x27;t seen me in a week.... sometimes they even call me to answer questions when they are doing inventory :)  :)  :).... well, they could.....   okay, back to the point.... I&#x27;&#x27;m a rambler.....  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you are looking for fine jewelry, shoes, underwear or egg timers.... Ross has it!  The actual fun of it is you never know what you will find from week to week.... (tip: they get shipments in on Tuesday nights....)  sometimes I find myself shaking and rubbing the crook of my arm desperate for a Ross fix.... I&#x27;m terrified they may have just the exact piece of brick a brack I&#x27;m needin&#x27; and I&#x27;ll miss it....... If they had groceries it would be truly one stop shopping.... of course, that would just be gross.... again, I ramble.....  You can find clothes, shoes, jewelry, purses, toys, homegoods, furniture, art, kitchen ware, hell, I even found a sink there once!  Take a LOT a smellin&#x27; salts with you when you go, cause&#x27; the shamefully low prices on everything will definitely give you the \&quot;vapahs\&quot;.......&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Amazed that I&#x27;ve never reviewed one of my favorite Ross locations in town. Being centrally located in Boca Park and close to my former Pilates Studio, I&#x27;ve spent many hours and $$$$ here over the years. \n\nIt just seems more \&quot;together\&quot; than other Ross choices and I&#x27;ve had incredible luck with one-of-a-kind finds: from designer clothes, shoes, rare purses, Pilates, Yoga BOSU and workout gear to baby, toddler and children&#x27;s clothes and toys. And yes, MANY Hello Kitty scores for me or those keeping an eye out for me. \n\nIt definitely reflects the neighborhood and carries more high end merchandise than locations a few miles away. Even their housewares from kitchen to furnishings eclipse other locales. It is a favorite spot for Mom and me to wile away the hours and meet up later to share our \&quot;finds.\&quot; \n\nDefinitely worth a visit for professional women who seek separates or need to buy suits that require extensive alteration. Much less expensive to buy that designer classic, have it altered to fit perfectly and still come in at half (or less) than you would at nearby boutiques. \n\nSeriously a place I adore, whether looking for Dead Sea Body Mud packs or Calvin Klein shoes, pillows, hose or clothing. They also have an amazing selection of high end (not just high TC) linens and I love that if I just need King pillow cases = Boom! \n\nThe only reason I hold back 5* is because check out can take a lonnnng time as can jewelry counter help. But that small annoyance is worth the fantastic pieces I continually score and am asked \&quot;where DID you find that?\&quot; \n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Came here as a last minute desperate act to find my two year old a dress. Yes, I will admit that I&#x27;m a procrastinator. Before this I had gone to Baby Gap, Target, and Walmart.. this was my last resort. Luckily this time it worked out.\n\nWalking in it was busy and I was dreading having to check out since there was a line. I practically ran to the back kids section. Sadly there was a very limited amount. I about died.\n\nLuckily two dresses popped out of the about 10 they had left. I was looking for a red one but sadly I was SH*T out of luck. Oh well. I guess the three generational picture we are taking tomorrow will have to be altered a bit. \n\nThe first dress had tags that said 29.99 and was for 8.99. YES, thank you! It was a beautiful 3T black dress with a grey blue bottom and tie. Instantly fell in love with it and knew it would go perfect with my great grandmothers pearls.\n\nNext, I saw a gorgeous cream, black and gold plaid dress. It screamed buy me and I just couldn&#x27;t say no. The tags on this one said 39.99 and it was at ross for 9.99. What a deal! Def was in shock.\n\nRunning to the check out line, I stood their for ten minutes which gave me a chance to  check out a few other items for a birds eye view. In distance I could see some guess bags for 15 bucks, normally 45. A couple dresses that were business oriented half priced. \n\nCashiers were friendly, fast and efficient. \n\nWhen im not in a rush, running like a chicken with a head cut off I will come back to check out the amazing prices and cute clothes.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This Ross location is so nice and clean compared to their east side locations.  And the prices aren&#x27;t competitive, they&#x27;re marked the same as the other locations.  But this store is so much more cleaner, or at least cleaned faster than the other Ross stores.  I like this location because when I go to the gun range at Desert Sportsman I can drop my lady friends here to shop around for an hour or so rather than stand around in the hot sun raining bullets at a target.  \n\nI&#x27;ve also been known to stop by and grab some targets at this store before heading to the range!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been liking Ross stores more, because there are lots of reasonable items for the home, and we usually find shoes for our son here (children grow fast, so we are constantly trying to keep up). Whenever we are in the immediate area stopping here is a must. There are quite a few dining options, so it&#x27;s a no-brainer. Sometimes, in the late afternoon, it does get pretty busy here. So we&#x27;ve been trying to get their before and after that time frame. \n\nSo, we like to check out the luggage, the childrens shoes, the home department (towels/ kitchen/ storage), our son always wants to check out the toys, hubby checks out the k-cups coffee, I check out the activewear (I&#x27;m always looking for Fabletics), beauty (I&#x27;m looking for the natural beauty items), and sometimes the womens shoes (I&#x27;m looking for Toms). \n\nIt&#x27;s pretty clean inside, too. The bathrooms are located near the dressing rooms. If there isn&#x27;t a crowd, checkout is fast. The customer base is mostly families with children.&quot;,

Are people that bad intentioned?  Anyway, great for the security and safety during our shopping experience; thank you for having security on site.  I guess we&#x27;ll never know... that \&quot;last one\&quot; item on the shelf that someone was eyeing on, and somebody else picks it up to purchase might cause a drama syndrome.\n\nI visited this location the day after Black Friday.  Pleased to find how kept and organized things were considering the holiday shopping rush has begun.  All the general gift stuff were up in the front on tables near the registers.  Very neat and orderly section.  I call it the fun stuff: perfume or cologne sets, bath/shower sets, cocktail mixes, chocolate box towers, trinket/jewelry boxes... Exciting!\n\nI was there to checkout their holiday decorations and get some ideas.  I ended up getting big baby girl a stylish jacket for Christmas.  For me it was an awesome find.  It looked like the last one left and clearance tagged.  Heck yes!  I know she&#x27;ll like it.  All the zippers worked and I didnt find any faulty stitching.  Hahaaa!  Does anyone else do inspections when they shop?  I recommend it.\n\nThis store has well stocked shelves and hangers of things.  Everywhere a thing thing!  Including stuff you can shop for, with a lazy mind.  You know you&#x27;ve thought it too - I dunno what to get (so &amp; so)... Hint general gift area right over there; the fun stuff up front!  Makes for cool gift exchange or White Elephant game items.&quot;,

Because it&#x27;s cheap and it isn&#x27;t overpriced. You can find the very same styles here that they have at other \&quot;high-end\&quot; stores like Forever 21. Instead of buying that $30 shirt, you can find something similar here for around $8 or less! I bought 15 items from this store the other day for LESS than $100. LESS! I would&#x27;ve paid OVER $100 if I went to another store. \n\nI leave here happy almost every time, and you bet I&#x27;ll be coming back again!&quot;,

Luckily, I married one savvy girl and she had shown me the light!\n\nThe place is usually clean and the clothes is in order.

The lack of consistency in their inventory is the only reason why I rank them lower. I can go to this one and find nothing, just to go to another store and score. Maybe since it is in such a nice area, most people scoop up the bounty before I can set eyes on them. \n\nThere is a plethora of stores around this area. I won&#x27;t be discouraged. Instead I will continue to make my rounds and focus on the great deals I do find here.&quot;,

I typically find linens, decor, kitchenware, and food items that I want the majority of the time.  Once in a while clothing that catches my eye.  The only downside is the carts must remain inside the store.  That actually limits what I can purchase since everything must be taken out in bags (bye bye cart).  Give me a cart and I&#x27;ll give you 5 stars.&quot;,

These guys are honest and don&#x27;t try to sell you things you don&#x27;t need. Jason (other mechanic) is funny and commented that at least I got my money&#x27;s worth off the old drum and brakes ( they were worn down quite a bit) nice to deal with people that have a good sense of humor.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Uh..I&#x27;m so sad I didn&#x27;t know about this place sooner! I went here for brunch and loved it. Tons of veg and vegan options. And they make a good americano (a must!).\n\nI had the vegan eggs benedict and it was quite good. I would have preferred that it came with potatoes on the side but at least I didn&#x27;t leave brunch feeling crazy full and sluggish as is usually the case after brunch out on a Sunday.\n\nIt didn&#x27;t seem that busy for a Sunday brunch, so maybe not too many people know of this place? Such a shame.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Let me start by saying that I love this place and am going to have to try to make it out to Bloordale more often!\n\n1st visit: I first visited The Steady Cafe for brunch last fall with a large group (10+? people).  I started off with the Southern Sinner ($9), which unfortunately took longer than I would have liked to arrive.  But when I tasted it-yum!  It tastes exactly as described (sweet tea, booze, and coconuts).  I&#x27;ve since tried two cocktails and the Southern Sinner is my favourite.\n\nI also ordered the Collard Stuffed Cornbread Waffle with Chipotle Maple Syrup ($13) and added a side of sausage (because I wanted a dose of protein).  One thing that annoyed me a bit was that the menu said that fruit was included on the side but the waitress didn&#x27;t bring it out.  When I asked about it, she thought that I was mistaken but later did bring the fruit out for me once she realized the error.  I appreciate that she was nice about it.  Another downside was that the sausage was sort of bland.  I had high expectations since I believe their sausage is homemade but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it.  The waffle was really good and very large.\n\nI also ordered the OMG Sugar &amp; Cinnamon Donuts ($6) and I really enjoyed these!  I wished that they were more moist but the coconut cream made up for it!  The cream had a mild coconutty sweetness to it and was at a somewhat cool temp which I really liked.  \n\nOverall, for this visit, the service was slow but to be fair, I was part of a large group.  At least the service was friendly.\n\n2nd visit: I visited again this past New Year&#x27;s Day for brunch in a smaller group. I ordered the Southern Sinner again and found it a bit weaker than what I remembered but tasty nonetheless.\n\nI also ordered the Skillet ($13) this time because I had sampled a friend&#x27;s plate during my first visit and remember wishing that I had ordered it instead of the waffle!  The Skillet didn&#x27;t disappoint - a nice mishmash of spinach, sausage, tomatoes, eggs, cheese atop hashbrowns brought out in a piping hot skillet!  This definitely gives alot of bang for your buck because it&#x27;s tasty, hearty, and very filling.  I was also pleased because the sausage was more flavourful than last time.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just that there was enough salt this time. Still it was a huge improvement.\n\nService was friendly as usual, which was more impressive considering our server had worked late the night before for New Year&#x27;s Eve!\n\n3rd visit: I recently went with a friend to try the new dinner menu which is VERY well-priced.  I made a change from my usual Southern Sinner and went with the Forbidden Fruit ($10) to start.  It&#x27;s not my favourite - I found it to be bland.  Next time, I plan to try the Dirty Jolene (with donut liquer!) or I can go with ol&#x27; reliable - the Southern Sinner.\n\nFor my main, I started out with the Enchiladas ($6). I LOVED these!  There were 3 smallish chicken enchiladas with a side of cumin sour cream.  I would say that they were mildly spiced but still very tasty.  I loved the seasoning of the chicken and the cumin sour cream took it over the top for me!  I have never thought of \&quot;spiking\&quot; sour cream with cumin but I may give it a try at home.  I think that this is a very economical dish - tasty and filling.  My friend ordered the Tequila Pine Burgerette ($7) and I thought it looked pretty small.  I had a taste of the burger itself and wasn&#x27;t wowed - but keep in mind that I didn&#x27;t really taste the slaw or mayo that was part of it.\n\nService was friendly as usual!\n\nOn another note, the washrooms are clean but they look like high school washrooms and they REALLY need to get one of the stall doors fixed.  Overall, I won&#x27;t let this deter me and can&#x27;t wait to return for dinner!!\n\nFinal note: Go to The Steady now!  For brunch and dinner!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Not only do they have my favourite Niagara Falls beer (Silversmith black lager), they offer vegan options as well as meat. Now both my boyfriend and I can enjoy dinner easily. Try the vegan salad it&#x27;s amazing!\nAfter we went once we found ourselves back twice more in a week.\nSo glad we stumbled on this this place.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been here twice, for both dinner and lunch, and had a great experience both times. For dinner I had the vegan burrito and it was great.  Fresh and tasty and refreshingly different. My husband had a quinoa taco salad (also vegan) and it was to-die-for.  \n\nFor lunch I had a grilled sandwich and coffee, also both delicious and reasonably priced. \n\nAside from the food, my favourite things about this place are definitely the service, which was awesome, the fact that they have plenty of vegan options, and the beer and drink selection. The space itself is also very cool and they have dance party nights that look like they would be a lot of fun. \n\nI will definitely return.&quot;,

I am a basic person so I usually order the \&quot;this or that\&quot; breakfast and man, the hasbrowns are the best I&#x27;ve ever had. This is saying a lot because usually a basic breakfast is just that, basic and this was not. \n\nThe service was also nothing short of awesome. \n\nI ordered donuts as an appetizer. Try the donuts.

My friend had the vegan eggs benie. We were both happy. She also had a mimosa for $6. \n\nThey have vegan doughnuts. Today was coconut. Absolutely delicious. Well worth the $3!\n\nLocated on bloor around dovercourt, it&#x27;s easy to get to by bike or subway.&quot;,

Plenty of vegan and gluten-free options (with a couple being in both categories) - including the only vegan donuts in the city that are also gf. Sadly they had just sold out of the donuts when we got around to ordering. Three of us had the vegan egg benny (mine on a tostada instead of the bun to de-glutenify it), and one person had the vegan banana foster waffle. Delicious food all around. Standard brunch pricing (vegan benny was $14), good portions.\n\nGreat atmosphere - pleasant music, loads of room between tables, pretty chill all around. Great service - very friendly and helpful. They seem accommodating as well in making substitutions, which is always incredibly pleasant and welcome.\n\nBathrooms could be cleaned more frequently. They were fine, but there was paper all over the floor. A sweep here and there would up the place for sure.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Went here with my fiance for brunch on a Saturday morning at 10:30am recently. When we arrived there were only a few other tables being used, but it got progressively fuller as the time went on.\n\nI had the special that day, which was a Miami inspired breakfast burrito. Overall, I&#x27;d say my meal was a 4 out of 5 and tasted just delicious. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s served with \&quot;salad\&quot; (aka lettuce...which seems to be the thing to put beside brunch and call it salad.) But the burrito was so good, I didn&#x27;t really care about what was beside it.\n\nMy fiance had the normal breakfast, you know, 2 eggs, hash browns and sausage. It wasn&#x27;t really that much of a standout, and she found that the sausage was SUPER full of rosemary, so if you&#x27;re not into that I&#x27;d say get the bacon.\n\nOur service was pretty good, however we did see two tables come in, sit for 15-20 mins then get up and leave. There was one server when we arrived, and the second server didn&#x27;t get there until 11:30 or so when we left...I guess they needed him earlier.\n\nOverall, this place was good, and if someone wanted to go there again I wouldn&#x27;t say no. However, in a city where you can find a well executed brunch with regular frequency, The Steady was good but not standout.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The Steady is pretty awesome. I had been watching the restaurant for a while, and had it on my \&quot;to check out\&quot; list, and as soon as I heard they launched a brunch menu, I could wait no longer! \n\nThey take reservations for brunch (more awesomeness points,) so I took advantage of this by bringing in a giant party of 16 to test out the brunch menu! They had no problems accommodating this, and set up two large tables in the back facing each other so our large group was able to stay in the same area.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking for some hair of the dog, they have a pretty awesome and creative brunch cocktail menu. I didn&#x27;t try one myself, but I heard some very good things from my fellow dining companions that did try one.\n\nThe Steady has a really alternative vibe (which I love,) and the servers and cooks really emulate that vibe also. While our servers were super friendly, service did leave a little something to be desired (could check in on us more, food and drinks were very slow, even for a group of this size) Note: no splitting bills here.\n\nThe food is amaaaaaaaaaazing. LOTS of options for meat lovers, vegans, and gluten intolerant people alike. The \&quot;This &amp; That\&quot; breakfast, that seems really simple, but consists of lots of breakfast staple options (eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuit or hashbrows, fruit or greens, etc.) and had, by far, the best scrambled eggs I have ever had the pleasure of consuming in my life. They were cooked perfectly, and seasoned sooo well. My description just doesn&#x27;t do them justice. I don&#x27;t know if they slip drugs into those eggs because they are addictive as heck, but trust me, try them. My boyfriend ended up ordering an extra side of 5 eggs because they were so good.\n\nI had the red velvet pancakes that came with a coconut sauce, and they were quite yummy. A HUGE portion size, I didn&#x27;t finish more than about a quarter of my giant stack. While good, they can get a bit one-note if you are eating the entire plate. I suggest getting a side of something or sharing the pancakes with a friend.\n\nCheck out the calendar on their website - they hold  a lot of cool events in the evenings.\n\nAnyway, had a fantastic time here, and really, just can&#x27;t wait to come back. What a gem.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;After visiting The Steady twice, I am sad to have to give it a 2 star review based on service. On both occasions I visited for drinks with friends on a Friday or Saturday night. After being seated by staff, my friends and I waited 20 minutes before our drink order was taken after asking for service. It was not overly busy on either occasion. After we got our drinks service continued to be poor. Went back the second time hoping for a better experience. Want to support this independent establishment with a good looking menu, but after these two unpleasant experiences I won&#x27;t be giving it a third try.&quot;,

The back room is perfect for an intimate party. The decore is the cutest too. My favourite part was their fake christmas-like palm trees, i must get my hands on something like that. It brings a whole new meaning to christmas in july. \n\nThe staff was also so nice! I&#x27;ve been to so many bars where the bartenders aren&#x27;t the friendlist( of course I understand what they have to go through most of the time) but here they were so friendly :)\n\nMy next step is to go and try their brunch that I keep hearing great things about. \nWhat a cool place, dancing and great food :)\n\nLove it!&quot;,

Super long line stood there for 15 minutes, never moved. No music or anything so it feels uninviting, not to mention I wasn&#x27;t greeted or talked to by any BOA employee. Also there was two people sitting in the lounge waiting to talk to a representative in which there was five representatives, two on a computer and 3 walking around talking amongst themselves. Only one of those two people was brought to sit down as I was leaving. Nobody was happy, it was a horrible experience. And all because the cash deposit outside at the ATM wasn&#x27;t working. Which by the way, a technician came to fix that machine pretty quickly, the but took just long enough for me to experience this banks customer service. \nThere is a lot of people going to this branch, maybe it&#x27;s time to hire more tellers and get things going here. \nI had to drive to the BOA on Craig and Rancho to make a deposit, ridiculous.&quot;,

We were very happy with our choice!  Our server was excellent and personable.  She even recomended some great wine. We were in for lunch, so we had oyster shooters ( good\nidea but oysters themselves tasted like they were canned - maybe I am used to fresh west coast oysters? Not sure), the shrimp BLT, and the club.  Both were excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a diverse menu with easy going ambiance and great customer service!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I always rated the service very high in this restaurant. I went back three times in the last 2 months and I would say this is a four. The food is killin!!! I have been with parties of 2 -5 persons and we all tried different appetizers and entrees, everyone was impressed, particularly with the steak entrees and salads. Okay wine list.Tonight I tried the Shrimp Manzetti&#x27;s. BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nGreat wait staff and the nicest hostesses in the restaurant business. \nBased on the variety of entrees I have tasted over the past three years in this establishment, they are well deserving of a four rating. I would consider this restaurant stop on a trip to Charlotte.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Since I travel so much, I think I only eat out in CLT when someone takes me. Boy, am I glad someone took me here!  \n\nAtmosphere - It is like a standard steakhouse, dark stained wood bar, white table cloth, hosts in black, servers in white. This and the location, South Park, led me to believe it would be pricey, for what you get it was not. \n\nService - Pleasant and willing to go with the crowd was our server. When she inquired if needed anything to make the dish spectacular, we asked what she had to accomplish this and she quipped \&quot;ketchup?\&quot; We all laughed. \n\nFood - To start we had calamari, which was lightly breaded and fried for the proper length of time. It came with a side of chunky marinara that added nicely to the dish. For the main, I had the 11 oz barrel cut filet mignon, medium. This came with a house salad (mixed greens, chopped eggs, almonds, tomatoes, bacon &amp; ham) w/ balsamic vinaigrette and my choice of side (mixed vegetables). The salad was basic, good and came w/ croissant drizzled w/ sweet honey. The filet was made to order, but the signature charring (see side note below) is an acquired taste. For dessert I had their, actually someone else&#x27;s, key lime pie as the pie is made based on a Miami Fl recipe. It was very good, but the texture was gritty which took away from it being perfect. \n\nPrice - Filet mignon, salad, mixed vegetables ($28.95), Fried calamari $8.95, Key lime pie $5.95 and water...priceless! (I always get water w/ a fine meal.) \n\nOverall - Great experience and will definitely go again. \n\nSide note: Being a former Pittsburgher, I enjoyed this off their menu explaining how the place started out and why they \&quot;char\&quot; the steak: \&quot;Shortly after Prohibition ended, Frank Manzetti, known as \&quot;Z\&quot; to his buddies in the East Side steakhouses, left Manhattan to open his restaurant on the South Jersey shore not far from Atlantic City. While serving a variety of foods, he specialized in steaks and his reputation for thick, juicy cuts with a seared exterior quickly spread in this vacation resort. One fateful day a tourist called Frank out of the kitchen to proclaim, \&quot;this steak sure tastes good, but it looks like something I pulled out of the fire at the steel mill where I work in Pittsburgh.\&quot; From that day forward, steaks prepared in the Manzetti style became known throughout the Western World, or at least Southern New Jersey, as \&quot;Pittsburghed\&quot; and \&quot;Z\&quot; Manzetti took on the additional moniker of \&quot;Pittsburgh Frank.\&quot; We welcome the chance to continue the tradition.\&quot; \n\nI enjoyed my meal an&#x27; nat.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I had my first experience at Manzetti&#x27;s last night...and I loved it.  The atmosphere was casual, but not overly casual.  The music was playing low, but it was pop music, creating a fun atmosphere.  The decor was simple, yet elegant, with dark wood features.  \n\nWe ordered cheap ($5-$6) glasses of wine (yes, they have them!) and they were delicious.  Having read good reviews about their chip appetizers, I decided that we had to try one.  We went with the spinach and cheese atop tortilla chips and it was a delicious way to start the dinner.  \n\nI followed up the app with the Spicy Shrimp Stuffed Baguette.  The presentation was very interesting.  A baguette was hollowed out and stuffed with shrimp in a brown sauce.  Eating it was easy because nothing fell out.  Biting into it was out of this world.  It had an explosion of cajun flavor that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  And, loving spicy food, the hotness factor was just right for me (although a bit too spicy for my partner).   The accompanying fries were plentiful, yummy, fairly thick, and fresh out of the fryer (ouch!).   \n\nManzetti&#x27;s is a great place to go for a night out or to bring out-of-town guests to impress them.  The American menu has enough to please those with a variety of tastes.  \n\np.s. The service was awesome, too, and the manager even stopped by to see if everything was okay.&quot;,

I&#x27;ve had a variety of items off their menu from salads, club sandwiches, to their bacon cheeseburger, again, all of which were great.\n\nI&#x27;ve only ever had one bad experience here which was at early dinnertime on a Saturday (4pm).  My wife and I took our kids with us to eat here and the waitress seemed extremely annoyed and bothered at the fact we brought children into the restaurant.  The service wasn&#x27;t that bad, there were just several sighs, grinch-looking faces, and disapproving looks throughout the service --in hindsight, perhaps she had gas?\n\nWith the exception of that experience, every other experience here has been great.  Good service, great food, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  I will be eating here again.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I have been a patient of Dr. Burns for over ten years. I see her for my yearly women wellness check ups. Last week I saw my primary care doctor who recommended I see my OBGYN as soon as possible. I called Dr. Burns office and they wouldn&#x27;t fit me into their schedule for a week. But I took solace in knowing I was seeing my doctor who has treated me for so long, I trusted her, especially since my diagnosis may require surgery. I showed up for my appointment only to be turned away, as they stated I was a half hour late and the doctor already left for the day. I showed up at the right time, I even got their voice mail confirming it! I asked to see her partner who was still in the office treating patients, and was refused! They don&#x27;t see each others patients. I explained how this was an emergency. They told me I needed to go to the ER or a quick care, and the women had such a smug look on her face. I was so disgusted and tired of arguing to people who obviously do not care, so I demanded my records. Which they wouldn&#x27;t provide to me for another week. I have never been so displeased with a physicians office. Especially since I work in the field, no professional courtesy, let alone they could care less about their patients. If this is the support staff that Dr. Burns wants to depend on and surround herself with then I can no longer trust or rely on her as my physician.&quot;,

But then when there was no answer for the symptoms I was having and I was told there was nothing they could do, I decided I deserved better care.  By the way, the second Dr. I went to prescribed a treatment and my symptoms cleared up in a week.  So, if you are looking for basic pelvic/pap annuals, this place is ok.  but if you&#x27;re in need of real diagnostic thinking outside the box or in need of someone who is on top of the latest information or holistic approach, then I would pass.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Overall really satisfied. So my biggest concern with a GYN is their \&quot;bedside\&quot; manners. Office staff, wait time can all be forgiven for a really nice, sincere doctor. I moved from LA 3 years ago and up until this year, I drove back to see my gyn. She was incredible. I made the mistake of going to Deseret Women&#x27;s Care before coming to Dr. Burns and it was awful. AWFUL. This appointment was for an annual so I cannot comment on how she is with any major medical issues.\n\nSo let me break A Woman&#x27;s Place down for you:\n\nCONS:\n1. Waited 30 minutes to get in.\n2. Office staff, neither here nor there.\n3. $2 charge for credit or debit...eh.\n4. REALLY small waiting area.\n\nPROS:\n1. As a new patient I could get an appointment the same week I went to book it. Dr Burns said it&#x27;s because they are strictly a gyn office...not ob.\n2. Nurses were super nice, really friendly. Non-judgemental.\n3. Dr Robi Burns was about as down to earth as a doctor could be. She was caring, sincere, open, direct, had a sense of humor, and she did her best to make you feel as comfortable as possible without going overboard and making it awkward. \n4. Dr Burns gave you the time and respect you deserve and need but she was in and out in a flash. Who wants to spend all day in there anyhow?\n5. A MATERIAL GOWN? No paper gown...sad but yes this is one of the highlights. \n\nHopefully there will be no billing issues...that is always were I have issues.\n\nEveryone is different in what you are looking for and are comfortable with. I will definitely return and I would recommend them to my close friends (and family if they lived here).&quot;,

I&#x27;ll be making the 40 minute drive to see her again.\n\nBut it was the little things about this place that bothered me enough to give a 3 star rating. The front desk girl was stand-offish and not very friendly, except when a regular walked in and she gushed all over her. Then she tells me they don&#x27;t take Discover. Then she tells me there&#x27;s a $2 fee to use a debit or credit card. I&#x27;m sorry, but that fee is your responsibility...jeez. The exam room was a little grungy and I didn&#x27;t feel like things were that sanitary. At least it didn&#x27;t smell like urine.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is easily the worst gyno I&#x27;ve been to. I have unfortunately been here twice and the second time only out of pure desperation because I needed a new script for the pill. Both times they messed up on my insurance information and i had to deal with my insurance, their office, and the lab that processed my Pap smear. No lie, that process took at least 4 months for everyone to get their act together. It was such a huge inconvenience that I was going to find another gyno for my second check up but I was running out of the pill and needed them to write me an emergency one month script till I could get an appointment. They forgot to call the prescription in. They forgot, after I called them twice to remind them what pharmacy and even their number!!! Like an idiot I didn&#x27;t call target to check before hand and drove all the way there to find out that they FORGOT!!!!! I cannot stress enough how awful this place is and please for your own sanity do not go to this place. I will never be returning.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I saw Haydee Docasar on 8/20/09, for a routine, yearly pap smear.\n\nI did not want any other tests, because I knew my insurance at the time would not pay for them.\n\nAfter my appointment,  I receive a bill from Quest diagnostics, for my pap smear, which was.....about $6. I paid it.\n\nAfter that, I receive another bill from Quest, only this time, for $160; \n\nfor tests CPT CODES 87591- Gonorrhoeae and Trahomatis.\n\nUNKNOWN TO ME, something from MY BODY, was sent out for testing.\n\nI tried calling AWP, and had several missed attempts. An employee named \&quot;Jimmy\&quot; and I were playing phone tag. After several calls, with no response, I figured that the issue was fixed. Seeing as how I did not ask for any tests.\n\n1/30/10,\nI get a collections notice, for the $160.\n\nOn 2/12 I sent a letter to AWP contesting these charges.\n\nDuring my visit, I was NEVER asked, nor where the tests addressed. I was not told by Docasar or the staff that samples would be sent to Quest for testing. I was there for a pap smear ONLY, and nothing else.\n\nI asked Docasar to pay the bill.\n\nI DO, along with any other patient, HAVE THE RIGHT OF REFUSAL.\n\n*****On 2/18 I receive an answer from AWP.\n\nDr. Docasar follows the recommendations of the \&quot;American College of Obstertrics and Gynecology\&quot; for sexually active patients ages 19 to 35 is a yearly PAP that includes a screening for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia. This is their standards, which I did not see marked on their paperwork. \n\nDr. Docasar agreed to pay the charges, and I was \&quot;dismissed\&quot; from Docasar&#x27;s care and AWP.\n\nFINE WITH ME.\n\nThe only reason why I&#x27;m giving her two stars is because she paid the charges. This place has NO right to do tests without patient&#x27;s permission.\n\nHaydee Docasar took it upon herself to conduct these tests without discussing them with me, and if she would have let me know that they were \&quot;mandatory\&quot; with a pap smear, I would have put my pants on and walked right out.\n\nThe filtered reviews on this place are also bad, I would check those out.&quot;,

She is very caring and sincere, listens to my concerns and makes wonderful recommendations of supplements that don&#x27;t require a prescription.\n\nIt was Dr. Docasar that got my out-of-control fibroids under control several years ago by doing an ablation, even going out of her way to bring in a machine from out of state for the procedure.  The recovery time was really quick with very little pain.  I understand she&#x27;s now able to do the procedures in the office.\n\nI&#x27;m currently undergoing painful menstrual cycles as my hormones are having a great time changing, and Dr. Docasar is working with me, discussing different options and providing an understanding ear.  It is very comforting to have someone I can trust so much that I&#x27;ve referred her to my sisters and friends.&quot;,

She is very personable and makes you feel comfortable asking those some times \&quot;embarassing\&quot; questions. The reason I did not give this office 5 starts is because there is only 1 and it is way out in Anthem! I live in Summerlin, but I still make the 40 minute drive out there every time I need to see an OB/GYN because the facilities are clean and modern, they offer many services including cosmetic and weight loss, and the doctors are very friendly.  I even called Dr. Burns on her cell once, and she answered and put my worries at ease.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend!\n\n:)&quot;,

The wrap even helped mask the issue slightly, and it&#x27;s completely invisible.  Every bit of paint flake is visible, minor scratches are self healing and the car looks incredible. \n\nThey might *sound* too good to be true, but they aren&#x27;t.

You can&#x27;t even tell it is on the car, the hood is wrapped and tucked in under the hood. He completely did the front end, mirrors, and my door edges. My vehicle detailer( Candies Mobile Detailing)  recommended Andrew and Oz Braz. I called him up and he went over all the options and discussed prices. Andrew also made the arrangements with the detail shop to get the appointment made. Payment was made easy by a link he sent to my email.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I had an experience that was the complete opposite to the one-star rating given in 2010. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were shopping for furniture, and we went EVERYWHERE. I had purchased from Brian&#x27;s in a previous \&quot;life,\&quot; so I decided to take my girlfriend there with me to look. \n\nBrian&#x27;s didn&#x27;t disappoint. They offer high quality furniture in high quality fabrics. Nearly all pieces of furniture can be upholstered in the fabric of your choosing, and they have a HUGE selection of fabrics to choose from. They also have wood furniture, dining sets, bedroom sets, cabinets... \n\nYou will not be hounded when you walk in the door. A salesperson may say \&quot;hello,\&quot; but they are not inclined to follow you around. You&#x27;re free to just look around. If you see something you like, ask and they&#x27;ll be happy to tell you all about the item(s) you&#x27;re interested in. Low pressure sales at its finest. And once you do decide to pull the proverbial trigger you&#x27;ll be shocked at how reasonable the price really is given the overall quality of the furniture, and fabric offerings available. \n\nWe purchased a sofa, two chairs and a sofa table. I will also be returning to price a custom entertainment center. That&#x27;s right, custom. Brian&#x27;s will build your furniture!!! It&#x27;s incredible! \n\nIf you&#x27;re looking for cheap discount furniture, Brian&#x27;s may not the place for you (I&#x27;d recommend Value City Furniture or Levin if that&#x27;s where you are budget-wise). But if you&#x27;re looking for some of the best quality furniture you can find this side of Amish Country, then go check out Brian&#x27;s; family-owned and operated since 1986. I promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&quot;,

Wes consistently does just that!  He answers phone calls, keeps the client informed and shows our clients that he truly cares about them.  On the most recent transaction we closed, the Title company told me that our lender, Wes and team, was ON POINT with their paperwork and deadlines.  Hearing that both my client and Title company were extremely happy with Wes tells me that we make a great team.  Thank you, Wes!!!!   Teresa @ Urban Nest Realty&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I come here weekly to volunteer for the Backpack program.  If you&#x27;re not aware of this program, Three Square provides \&quot;backpacks\&quot; of food for hungry kids that are enrolled in the school lunch program in order to give them food for the weekends.  It is a really great program and they serve approximately 7000 kids in multiple schools and counties in Nevada.\n\nWhile I admit the backpacks are mostly full of stuff I&#x27;d never eat or give my kids (chocolate milk, frosted flakes, vienna sausage, etc), I still think it is a worthwhile program and I&#x27;m proud to be one of the people that helps stuff the packs with food and gets them out to hungry kids.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I went to Three Square last night for the Roasting Las Vegas fund raising event.  The title of the program was \&quot;Roasting Las Vegas: The Critics can DISH it out, but can they take it?\&quot;  As it turns out, they can and it was a lot of fun!\n\nWhen I arrived at Three Square, my first time there, I was taken back by the huge size of the buildings where canned food is stored for distribution, other food is prepared for delivery to kitchens for serving those in need, and all the other space needed for helping to feed the hungry in Las Vegas.  The numbers are staggering but the one that hit me the most was that they serve one in four children in Las Vegas.  That&#x27;s a staggering number of kids who depend on Three Square to augment or provide their food needs.\n\nThe three reviewers being roasted were Max Jacobson, Al Mancini, and John Curtas. Their reviews appear in the local free papers and they are known to the foodie community in Las Vegas.  This was a chance for the chefs to fight back, so to speak, and roast these critics for what they&#x27;ve said in their past reviews.  Chefs there to roast were Todd Harrington (executive chef of Central by Michel Richard in Caesars), Stephen Hopcraft (executive chef of STK in the Cosmopolitan and former Top Chef contestant), Gary LaMorte (corporate chef for the Michael Mina Group), Vic Vegas (executive chef of Vic&#x27;s Restaurant in Henderson and former Next Food Network Star contestant), Carla Pellegrino (executive chef of Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina in Town Square and former Top Chef contestant), and Beni Valasquez (exceutive chef at the Bar + Bistro in the Arts District). Also roasting was Theresa Woo of the family that owns Fu in the Hard Rock Hotel).\n\nIt was a fun evening with a lot of laughs, some good food, and good beer and wine or so my table mates told me.  I managed to get a table near the front and next to the three tables where the chefs and their friends sat.  What a great way to help Three Square and get to see and hear the chefs we know and the critics we read.\n\nNow it&#x27;s time for me to volunteer some time at Three Square and help out with their amazing work on behalf of the people in need in Las Vegas and Southern Nevada.  Next up for fundraising is Dish 2013 on September 26th at the Palms Hotel and Casino.  Join me there!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I came here for a seminar on Extreme Couponing a few weeks ago.  I have always wanted to check this place out and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  \n\nEverything that Three Square stands for is just awesome.  They had the lady from Extreme Couponing: All Stars speak about how to do what she does (which is work, but saves you money).  She had appeared on the All Star edition where they shop and at the conclusion of their shopping trip, they donate all of the food to a local food bank.  She had given all of hers to Three Square, which is where the event was held.\n\nNot only was the building easy to locate, the building we were in was so hip and cool.  Super clean inside.  There are so many different directions to go in the building according to the arrows posted.  There was another building next door, but it wasn&#x27;t open.  I plan on coming back over the summer to do community service.&quot;,

Is to feed schools and shelters,  etc. They have plenty of volunteer events throughout the month and serve the whole  southern Nevada area. The only other one is located in Reno. They have two hour shifts to pack meals or distribute packages to go out for delivery. \nI have to say I&#x27;m thankful for the opportunity and will pass the word on to my friends to do this with me! ! Let&#x27;s go!!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;With its mission to provide hunger relief, Three Square Food Bank is definitely paying it forward.  I had the opportunity to visit the campus while attending the launch for Spring Restaurant Week with Misti Y., Chad S., and a few other cool Yelpers.  The campus is located off the I15 and Craig, in a business park, so you can&#x27;t tell from the outside how nice it is inside and the good work happening there every day.  The organization&#x27;s two main programs are the Food Bank and Food Rescue.  Working in conjunction with dozens of companies and individuals who donate food and funding, Three Square then distributes those donations to Agency Partners, non-profit and faith-based organizations that include soup kitchens, church pantries, shelters, and schools.  As visitors at the launch party, guests were able to see the kitchens and some of the meeting rooms, as well as mingle with Three Square staff. Portions of proceeds from Spring Restaurant Week directly benefit Three Square, thus the reason for the launch being held at the campus.  Organizations such as this are to be granted the highest respect, commended for the work they do to, as their mission statement says, serve not only food, but hope in the Southern Nevada community.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;What&#x27;s not to love about the only food bank in Southern Nevada, one of only two in the whole state(the other is in Reno)?  The work they do at Three Square to help feed the hungry of our community is incredible.  If you are looking to help out and give back, come here.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to volunteer at this facility since I heard about it, but it&#x27;s difficult with my work schedule during the week.  Three Square has volunteer hours available on the first Saturday of the month for individuals and groups and I thought it would be great to get some friends together for my first time.  We worked the three hour shift, from 9:00am to 12:00pm sorting and packing food for distribution.  Patti Johnson, the fabulous and friendly volunteer coordinator, gave us a tour of the facility first and explained the history of the food bank--impressive to say the least -the warehouse looks like Costco!  Three Square takes donations, sorts them, packs them, and then ships them off to local food pantries, shelters, non-profits, etc.  They also have a a program for food-insecure senior citizens, a backpack program for children who need food over the weekend, as well as an after-school and summer time program for the kids.  \nIf you&#x27;re looking for a place to volunteer some time and give back to the community, look no further than Three Square.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I volunteered here one day, with no idea what I&#x27;ll be doing here. Had visions of stirring 50 gallon vats of soup and chopping up veggies. Luckily, I did not get the chance to hurt myself with knives and boiling hot soup. Instead, I got to package grilled chicken sandwiches with an apples, pack of mayo and pieces of carrots. Worked in an assembly line of volunteers and I was the mayo and box sealer guy, The box food is for kid&#x27;s who may not have any food for dinner(school provides lunch for these kids). The package box dinner is delivered that night to over 400 kids in Vegas! Oh by the way the facility there is AWESOME! Very nice counter tops and appliances. The people that run the place are very nice, friendly, and happy to have you there. I even got a free 3 square bracelet out of it! And found out that an episode of Top Chef was filmed there!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Had the opportunity to volunteer here last weekend thanks to Terri R. who organized it. This food bank is the only one here in Southern Nevada, as the other one is in Reno. So you can imagine what a task it is for them to service the Vegas Valley. The food warehouse was as big as Costco! We were given a tour and also briefed on this wonderful organization. They are able to turn $1 into 3 meals. Bringing food is great but Three Square is able to get the best price possible for food with their purchasing power so seems like monetary donation is better. But they will take food as that is what we spent the morning sorting through looking at expiration dates. Then we packed them up in boxes to be shipped out to the different food facilities throughout Las Vegas.\nIt is heartbreaking the number of kids that go hungry in our community and now with school almost out, most of these children won&#x27;t be able to count on a meal. Three Square is working on a summer meal program to feed these kids.\nI encourage anyone to donate their time, food or money to this worthy organization. No one should ever go hungry....especially children.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This year I finally got a chance to sign up and volunteer at the Three Square Food Bank. Initially I called the Food Bank to sign up and the employee I spoke to informed me that I could sign-up online and view the volunteer calendar. At that point, I went online to the volunteer page and completed the forms. It only took a few minutes and after about 10-15 mins I was able to log in and view the calendar. \n\nI was able to volunteer several different days and during those days I worked in the volunteer room. In the volunteer room we sorted and box or bagged food for distribution by the food bank. The employees in this area were really nice and organized. The food bank also uses an electronic sign-in system for volunteers and automatically tracks your volunteers hours. Each volunteer also has there own identification number which is also nice because it keeps things organized. \n\nI really hope to be able to volunteer again with Three Square and possibly work in one of the other volunteer areas like the kitchen preparing school lunches. I think the employees, building, and programs at the Three Square campus are all great. The building is clean and beautiful and I really can&#x27;t wait to go back because my experience was so great. The organization of the staff really stood out and made me happy because I felt my time was used efficiently.  \n\nFYI- I just learned that they some times offer Saturday volunteer opportunities in the volunteer room in addition to the other weekend programs they offer.&quot;,

Bins were organized along 2 sides and ready for us to gladly tackle it! We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!), grabbed a plastic bag, went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3,200 bags! It&#x27;s such a shame any child is hungry, but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before, but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I&#x27;m happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again!

I wish I could say i stop by to volunteer but i barely have time to think with everything I&#x27;m doing with my life. But as for these BINGO events, they are always fun and the people who attend are so full of excitement. The workers/volunteers who help carry out the event do an awesome job. During the BINGO events, you can order food from the volunteer staff that comes around to take orders. Their food isn&#x27;t bad and the pricing for it isn&#x27;t outrageous.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I know this review is long overdue but really thinking of best way too Honor such class act organization. Organization that gives SO much back into our own community making sure no ones goes hunger man, women, or child. Every year they do wonderful job with Restaurant Week here in Vegas. Launch the event had party with some of the restaurants participating dishes out some of there food and wine. They had so much food not sure if able too get taste of all of them. Everything that had opportunity too taste was awesome. The location is kind of sneaky since its off the road tucked in the back. Once you find it AMAZED with the inside from the classy show kitchen area right up front (they were serving up some of tasting menu items), the meeting rooms, dining area, and caught quick glance of the kitchen. Everything is all state of the art and shows the amount of support and class act organization. I love three squares logo is clear, bold, and shows the mission statement below it. I meet some  of the upper management. Brain believe his name. Too see him walking around dishes out samples, hearing the enthusiasm, and passion ever worker at three squares. Makes me proud know amazing non profit organizations care about world we live in the need less fortunate ones in life!!! \n\nThanks for Terri R for taking me along for this event. Too see more fellow yelpers that night all supporting wonderful cause. Thanks too Misti for always keeping yelping not only fun but all kinds of events that shows yelper care about our community. It good times meeting lot of new yelpers that night!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I volunteered here for the first time and absolutely LOVE what they stand for! We were given a tour I the facility and I was just amazed of how many individuals they are able to help in the community. They are able to get dinner bags to children in a discrete way that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t eat dinner because their family don&#x27;t have the financial resources to provide it. I look forward to helping out more and getting my teenage daughter involved as well so she can see that other people don&#x27;t have it as easily as some.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is a great charity that I will enjoy participating.  Anything to do with food, you have my attention.  Added value is that I will be helping those who need it the most.  I will sadly admit I have only volunteer once, for the Backpack for Kids program.  But they are the sponsor behind Restaurant Week that happens twice a year.  So after attending an Yelp event where they have an assortment of charities that Yelp is partnered with, I took the time to educate myself with this charity by speaking to someone there.  With that being said, they have A LOT of opportunities for volunteering and have fun at the same time.  My next visit to them will be to help pack dinners for kids and that would mean I get to be in their kitchen!  I have walked by their kitchen and seen the operation and I am all excited to be able to be in that kitchen and working...updates soon to follow my experience in this kitchen!&quot;,

I&#x27;ll share this:\n\n2 times a week back pack program - roughly 7000 bags of food for underprivileged children who we ensure have food to eat over the weekend when they go home Friday after school.\n\nNutritious meals provided at schools that need help feeding low income children throughout the valley\n\nProviding food to all the various agencies throughout the valley that helps low income people (children, families, and seniors)\n\nI love this organization and I encourage everyone in the valley to learn about three square, hunger and how we all need to take an active part in getting rid of <a href="http://hunger\n\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/" rel="nofollow">hunger\n\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/</a>&quot;,

The facility is absolutely gorgeous, and immaculate. The team is friendly, upbeat and on the same page. They explain the entire story of Three Square to you, and set you up for success while volunteering by getting your heart in the right place. Taking every precaution to be sanitary, you&#x27;re fit with gloves and a hairnet after washing your hands. \n\nInside the kitchen, you&#x27;re assigned to a line and shown what to do. There are &#x27;runners&#x27; who will refill your station for you when you run out of food, so you don&#x27;t have to leave your post. The process is organized and precise, and you&#x27;re mixed in with experienced volunteers so there&#x27;s help all around you if it&#x27;s needed. Perfection. \n\nI love that in a mere 4 hours, you&#x27;re able to help pump out up to 10,000 meals for those who don&#x27;t have access to them. ...and we&#x27;re not talking fast food. These are healthy, balanced meals that will fuel bodies instead of bogging them down. I love it. \n\nMy team had such an incredible experience here, that we plan to volunteer once each month. \n\nI&#x27;m super impressed by you, Three Square. Thank you for all you do for our community! :)&quot;,

Their building/warehouse is beautiful and spacious inside, and the volunteer area - where I&#x27;ve sorted cans/items and packed boxes with the Las Vegas Wranglers hockey team - is clean and organized. \n\nAll of the Three Square staff and volunteers I&#x27;ve worked with have been super friendly and welcoming. When you show up to volunteer, they do a great job of getting you situated and answering questions along the way. \n\nThree Square is doing something important and crucial for our city, and it&#x27;s always worth helping them out with a donation of goods or your time. Lovely organization!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Three Square has to be in my top 3 favorite charities in Las Vegas. Their mission is simple, feed local families in need. At school, at home, at work, on weekends... Three Square is there to help feed members of the community. They are savvy enough to throw some great event while fund raising, so check out their website for upcoming events. Also take a look at the volunteer schedule. There are opportunities almost every day and it&#x27;s an easy process to get a group signed up for a day of volunteering. The Yelp volunteer day was on a Thursday morning and we ended up packing weekend bags of food for children. It was an easy gig (there were children and seniors helping out) and overall we packed over 3200 weekend meals in about 2 hours. Not into volunteering? That&#x27;s OK. This is one charity where your money is well spent if you feel like donating some green bills.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Three Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area charities for distribution to those in need.  They don&#x27;t distribute directly to families, instead they collect all of the items, sort it, and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.\n\nMy family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It&#x27;s monotonous work, but if volunteers don&#x27;t do it the work doesn&#x27;t get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.\n\nThe facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.\n\nI encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It&#x27;s really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here&#x27;s the link to more info and to the online volunteer <a href="http://form:\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/%5Cn%5CnWe" rel="nofollow">form:\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/\n\nWe</a> enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we&#x27;re a part of this community.&quot;,

I even remember reaching out to fellow Yelper, Cresta I, who use to have weekly check in&#x27;s here. She gave me the scoop, told me how to sign up, and then it was up to me. Fast forward a couple of months later and I still haven&#x27;t volunteered here.  It wasn&#x27;t until Terri R organized a sort-a-thon for us Yelpers, that I finally got the chance to give back.  Terri is the best and sets this up monthly.  \n\nThree Squares Food Bank is clean and very organized. To volunteer, you don&#x27;t have to procrastinate like me and wait for a Yelp round up.  You can complete an application in person or sign up through their website.  Yes, it&#x27;s that easy. Once you&#x27;re signed up and commited, Three Square will assign different jobs depending on what&#x27;s needed. Our job was to sort pallets of food, drinks, snacks, baby items, clothing, and miscellanous items.  Once sorted, the pallets are then brought into their warehouse pending distribution.  If you&#x27;re willing to donate about 3 hours of your time to give back, I recommend giving Three Square Food Bank a shot.&quot;,

Volunteers pack bags of food for kids who do have a meal when they get home at night or for the weekends they are out of school. \n\nI&#x27;ve volunteer a handful of times here and every time I am impressed at how much they do and how much they have grown in the past five years. \n\nVolunteering with this organization is easy and there are plenty of opportunity.

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for a place to volunteer and give back, this is the place! I know many may feel like volunteering sometimes seems a little overwhelming. I volunteered here with Charlie L, and it was such a wonderful experience! They have three warehouses that are huge! The interior of the main warehouse is very modern and hip. The facilities are clean, and they are very good about following sanitation guidelines,\n\nI got to pack already made cooked meals into those little tv dinner trays to sell to the senior centers and hospitals. I must admit. The food looked so delicious! I really wanted to try it! They had corn with pieces of minced bell peppers, baked chicken with bbq sauce, and seasoned baked potatoes. we pack them into the tv dinner, and weight them precisely to the ounce so everyone gets a fare share (no one gets one more potato than the other!). Pablo, the chef, was such a nice and funny guy! He helped make the experience fun for us, and cracking jokes and teasing me! He&#x27;s amazing. \n\nThe place is so friendly! The staff is wonderful, and great part is, we gave back and even went home with new friends. I even got to know my assembly line friend. He loves to cook and was a part of an externship for his culinary school. \n\nThanks again Three square! I&#x27;ll be back to give back! :)&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I came here about three times with my service organization and it&#x27;s without a doubt a great place to volunteer at! Anything that involves giving back to my community, I&#x27;m all in. I love this place because it allows people to help other people who need it. Hunger is an existing issue in Vegas, and Three Square is an organization that made it possible to create change to feed as much of our hunger population in Vegas.\n\nWhen I volunteer, it is always food-packing meals for students, or packing assorted fruits in bundles. Either way, we were always dealing with a sanitary environment with special instructions on the amount and quality of food we&#x27;re supposed to pack.\n\nIt takes a couple of hours to get as much in as we can. It&#x27;s like working in a fast paced environment and always constantly on the move. I absolutely have no problem with that when I know that the more we&#x27;re able to make, the more we&#x27;re able to feed.\n\nThis is a great organization with a large and clean environment to work in. The workers are informative and very friendly. I know that the org has a lot of potential in making bigger changes here. If you&#x27;re about serving the community, come down to three square!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Once again the Palms Pools provided a welcoming venue for the 4th Annual Dish Las Vegas event benefiting Three Square and its efforts to provide food for the hungry and strive to establish a hunger free community.  There were not as many local restaurants participating this year, and beef was less prevalent than scallops, but with the dynamic Zowie Bowie and Marley Taylor performing and backed by an energetic band, the live entertainment was much improved, and there was still fine food aplenty.  \n\nMy favorite samplings this time were N9NE&#x27;s huge King Crab Claws, excellent Crab Cake and hot Shrimp from Rhythm Kitchen, Cold Filet Salad and delicious Seared Scallop with a spicy bite and creamy Potato Foam offered by The Charcoal Room, excellent Russian Black Caviar graciously provided by Artisinal Foods, and Chocolate Hazelnut Cake and several other decadent desserts laid out by Chocolate &amp; Spice Bakery.  \n\nBesides the scantilly-dressed lady whose body was painted with bright colors during the event, one of the most interesting looking dishes was RM Seafood&#x27;s Peruvian Bay Scallop on a bed of Chinese Black Beans with Lime &amp; Micro Mint inside a clam shell.  I got to meet and speak with its owner and Executive Chef, Rick Moonen, as well as Executive Chef Stephen Hopcroft of STK.  A couple of my eating experiences were mixed.  Top of the World&#x27;s Salmon with Lemon Buerre Blanc contained tasty salmon, but the strong lemony flavor of the Lemon Buerre Blanc overwhelmed the fish.  And, although I liked NOVE&#x27;s grilled Pork Belly with Butternut Squash, the flatbread that accompanied it was rather bland and undistinguished.  \n\nThe night passed swiftly and enjoyably as the 300 or so attendees sampled various culinary inventions.  And it was all for a very good cause!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Located in North Las Vegas off Craig &amp; Pecos you will find this beautiful facility with a North &amp; South campus. If you are a visitor you do have to check in at the North Campus first. Three Square Food Bank is AWESOME! I just recently started volunteering more this year with my job, and Three Square has been one of the consistent places that we partner with to come out and help. \n\nBeing a volunteer and apart of such a great movement just really feels good. One of the great things that I learned on my first visit here is that they don&#x27;t just feed families in Clark County but also Nye, Lincoln and Esmeralda! The food that they receive comes from multiple resources such as local retail and grocery stores\n\nThe actual volunteer work is really fun and rewarding! It works just like a buffet.. Essentially they line up all these different canned foods and snacks so that you can just go down the line and put whatever quantity of items are needed for each bag and once you reach 3,000 bags for that day your humble volunteer work is done! I will be back many more times throughout the year.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Jillian has just moved to a new location in Scottsdale, much closer to where I live, so couldn&#x27;t be happier. For the rest of you, she is now offering promotions through Yelp: 20% off your first massage and a $49 for $89 deal. She also discounts a session $15 in your birthday month. \n\nAs of 8/1/2015, Jillian is housed within the Jo&#x27; Paris Salon &amp; Spa, although she is still an independent business owner separate from the salon. As a guy, I&#x27;ll admit to having been a little more comfortable walking into the chiropractic office where she use to be located. But I needn&#x27;t have worried about the salon. Jillian was there to greet me at the door and usher me to her area. So don&#x27;t worry about it guys. And gals, you&#x27;ll be right in your element.\n\nJillian is an experienced LMT with a broad skillset. This visit she was able to instantly diagnose why I was experiencing lower back and hip pain after long drives in my wife&#x27;s new car. Amazing. Problem solved. As importantly, she listens to your needs and is a genuinely warm and friendly personality. I would highly recommend that you take advantage of one of her current promotions and give her a try. \n\nThen head across the parking lot for a healthy bite at Mad Greens.&quot;,

Jillian knows my trouble areas and uses the right amount of pressure to release all the knots I&#x27;ve built up during my training.  She&#x27;s stuck with me till she retires!!!  I recommend her to all of my clients.  Trust me, if you want a real therapeutic massage, you&#x27;ve got to try Jillian; you&#x27;ll never go to anyone else!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This place used to be Singapore Sams. Since then it has changed hands several times. I decided to give this place a fair try, not really expecting much. Don&#x27;t knock it until you try it, right?\n\nThey have a day time buffet, that runs along side dim sum service. We request dim sum, and we get seated. Then for a long time afterwards we weren&#x27;t served at all. The 3 waitresses serving the total of 7 tables (5 of which were doing buffet) were stupendously busy. I wish I knew how to look at busy at my day job. Then people would think I&#x27;m actually working all the time.\n\nWhen we finally did get served, our food took nearly half hour to arrive. All of it was lukewarm.\nMost of it was unsalted. And the soy sauce was bland/diluted. Upon going to the washroom, I passed by the buffet and realized many of our items were at the buffet. So then...why did our food take half an hour? The menu also has a few items that are translated wrong. We got a few things that we didn&#x27;t intend to order. Overall, the meal was $60 with tip between 3 people. \nI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be coming here again.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Poor customer service! They put ads in magazines about discounts and then do not honor them.\n\nMost importantly they cheat their consignors. I consigned a pair of Prada boots I paid $1200 for at Neiman Marcus and told them not to take Lesa than $300 for them because I can&#x27;t take less than $150 or I would do better posting them for sale on eBay otherwise. When they did sell they informed me they got $80 for them and my share was $50. They acted as if they were doing me a favor because they give 50 percent split on high end merchandise. This was so upsetting that I didn&#x27;t shop there for 2 years. When I went back in the other day the daughter confronted me about it saying they have a stellar reputation and sorry it didn&#x27;t work out the way I wanted it. She was rude and disrespectful.&quot;,

I did not relize until I was speaking to my daughter after we left. She said they did the same thing to her and then told her she can use the app discount later on another visit. Hello?&quot;,

Not that I&#x27;m saying Bruster&#x27;s is bad or anything, it just tasted like normal ice cream kinda like Water &amp; Ice back in the day. \n\nI came here when they first opened! The service was good, there was only one guy working in there, and he seemed new but he was really nice! We kinda had a wait since it was a one-man crew, and there was one person in line with two kids but it&#x27;s all good, I understand! When it was our turn he let us sample whatever we wanted and answered my wife&#x27;s questions to the best of his ability. \n\nI got a butter pecan and cotton candy scoop on a waffle cone, my wife got some kinda of Galaxy swirl. Like I said, it was good, not great! Tasted very \&quot;normal\&quot; to me, nothing extravagant like what I&#x27;ve had at places like Screamery in Tucson, or Bi-Rite in San Fran where it has over 5000 reviews. I would rate it  but I&#x27;m gonna rate it 4 stars because of the service. \n\nThe guy who was helping me saw my dog, and offered an ice cream treat for my dog! It was so cute to look at and my dog was so happy!!! I&#x27;ll have to go to this place again, I&#x27;ve only been twice, but yeah sorry for ruining the perfect score!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;To be honest I almost like Bruster&#x27;s more than Salt &amp; Straw, it was that good. The serving size is decent, the texture is spot on, the flavor is rich, and the price was perfect! So good and so cheap! Loved it and I would go again if I even lived in the area&quot;,

I was shocked to find out that they opened up a location here in Arizona. I have been reading reviews in the last couple days that they have closed up shop permanently. I uge you to please open up a location in PHOENIX as the Gilbert location was very out of the way. The fact that I drive 50 minutes to get Brusters ice cream when it was in Gilbert speaks to how good their ice cream really is.&quot;,

The vanilla is so creamy and buttery, the consistency isn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried before and aside from the delicious frozen concoction, the customer service was top notch. Very friendly atmosphere. If you&#x27;re looking for something different, stop on by!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I was sucked in by the 5 star reviews. I went in person to order a birthday cake for my wife.  After ordering, they called me back about 15 minutes later, advising they didn&#x27;t have any vanilla (??) but could make the cake with chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.  I agreed.  They told me the cake would be ready at 4pm the following day (my wife&#x27;s birthday).  \n\nI arrive at 4:30PM and there is a sign up \&quot;sorry ran out of ice cream\&quot;. Knocked on the window and got someone to come out.  Told him I had a cake to pick up.  He went in the back and then called someone on the phone.  Then came to the front and said \&quot;sorry it didn&#x27;t get made\&quot;. So 4:30pm and they couldn&#x27;t have told me this a LOT earlier, before I drove all the way out to pick it up?  \n\nSo they received my money anyway, as I made the mistake of buying a Yelp \&quot;deal\&quot;.  Which is $15 for nothing but a headache in my case.  \n\nThank God for the Cold Stone on Power Road in Queen Creek! They had a pre-made cake and even decorated it for me at 5:30pm.  \n\nNever again guys. Fool me once, shame on you.&quot;,

I wish they had more of selection but overall I would definitely return.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;4 and 5 star reviews, I love it.  It is deserved.  This place is authentic, delicious old fashioned ice - cream.  The Peanut Butter parfait is seriously a Peanut Butter lovers dream.  Loaded with chunks of peanut butter (not PB cups).  It must be their top seller because if you go there late, they are sold out of that flavor.  The whipped cream is fluffy and delicious, the hot fudge is rich and chocolaty.  LOVE this place.  They will even serve your puppy a doggy sundae with a little treat on top.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so close to my house because now I cannot stop eating there.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We found this gem on Mothers Day weekend and so glad we did. Their flavors are so delicious!! They have speciality flavors and many others to choose from. They make it daily so during the day as they sell out the list gets smaller. \n\nIf you fall in love with a flavor you can even call them the day before and they will have it ready for you. My favorite is the Key Lime  Pie \n\nMust try the waffle cones also as they are made fresh daily. \n\nIf you can&#x27;t decide just ask for a sample and you can try until you fall in love with one of the amazing flavors. \n\nIf your in the area you must stop by!!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;So we&#x27;ve been 3x to really give it our approval or not. Went on Mothers Day. The 2 young men working were very nice! They told me about the little kid cone for my toddler, but she insisted on \&quot;big girl\&quot; ice cream. They also let them taste flavors. When I didn&#x27;t order anything for myself, he seemed disappointed and said \&quot;but, it&#x27;s mothers day?!\&quot;. I said that&#x27;s what mothers do. Everything was great. Lots to choose from. Great service.\nWent a second time on a Sunday afternoon. Again great service but 1/2 as many ice cream flavors to pick from. A third time on a Saturday night within an hour of closing. They were super busy still. But they did their best to get people served quickly. BUT... They had posters up of ice cream they said they didn&#x27;t even have yet. We tried to order 2 other flavors on the board that they were out of. Seriously there was about 6 flavors to pick from. There were 7 of us that went, and 3 decided to not get anything due to choices available. We will definitely be back by I may call ahead to ask what flavors they have! Coconut chip and peanut butter cream is to die for! Can&#x27;t wait to try the ones on the poster also! Portions are gigantic. A small is more than enough for any normal adult. Lol&quot;,

Friendly staff, happy to let me try multiple samples, and yes!, all of the flavors were soo rich and delicious! I ended up getting the Irish Cream and the Coffee Toffee! Boston creme pie was super good too!! Mmmm!! I will definitely be back!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I really like the idea of this place: Walk-up window where you can order ice cream. There is a very large menu of items from which one can order. However, I feel that all these options are mediocre and almost overwhelming. We sampled multiple flavors, and I felt that the ice cream lacked distinguishing features. I am a huge cookie dough fan...I could call myself a cookie dough aficionado. Their cookie dough mix-in was kind of sad. I got a cone with cookie dough mix-in. Essentially, my cookie dough was scooped on top of my cone and pressed down into the cone so that it would stay. On the other hand, the service was phenomenal. Everyone was very friend, patient, and helpful. It did take them a while for us to order our items since they were training new people, but they made up for it when we interacted with them. This place is good enough, but I wouldn&#x27;t take my out-of-town friends/family here if they were looking for a good AZ ice cream store.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is a fantastic airport that is very close to YYC. Service is excellent and the decor is stunning. The main lobby should be featured in a photo shoot - love the giant gold ottoman and stack of gorgeous pillows - and the rooms themselves are immaculately clean and graciously appointed. The shower head is fantastic, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re at a spa. This place is affordable and makes you feel like you&#x27;re at a high end resort rather than beside a scrap yard by the airport. I am seriously looking forward to my next trip to Calgary so I can stay here again. Don&#x27;t forget to use the bathrooms by the south entrance (by the convention center). Super clean and simply beautiful. Highly recommended.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;One of the most beautiful Radisson lobbies that I have ever seen. Lobby, hallways and rooms were fully remodeled (or new). Staff was friendly, check in was quick, internet worked like a charm and parking was free. The room was completely remodeled, comfy beds, large LED TV with cable, nice convenient lamp shades and plenty of charging ports. They also provided water and coffee maker in room which was especially helpful when you have a 6 am flight. The room also had a controllable thermostat and a functioning AC. They also have heated tiles, which I am sure will be a nice touch during the winters. They offered us 20% discount on breakfast, which was a nice gesture - however, we didn&#x27;t use it as we had an early flight. They do have an airport shuttle and are about 12 min away from departures. Overall great experience and would come back.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;My wife and I stayed here for a couple nights just to get away from Edmonton. Check-in and check-out was easy. For whatever reason two queens is a cheaper rate here than one king, which I would have preferred. They tried to upsell us but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. In any case, we were extremely pleased with the rooms and it was probably the cleanest hotel I&#x27;ve ever stayed at. Obviously it&#x27;s very new as even the furniture still smelled new. The rooms are large and the washroom even has heated floors. What a bonus. The indoor pool facilities were nice to use and the sauna was immaculate. If someone told me the sauna was brand new and opened that day I would have believed it. \n\nUnfortunately this hotel is in the middle of no where so either make sure you have a car or are headed to the airport with their shuttle. Our room overlooked a neighbouring junk yard full of beat up cars. Keep the curtains closed I guess as it&#x27;s quite the eyesore. Also, on the second morning we were there, we were woken up by a crying child next door which seemed to last forever. Not much the hotel can do about that but it really seemed like the father was egging him on which I thought was rude since it was still early. Definitely the hotel could have been constructed with better insulation between the walls because we could even hear the parents just chatting at normal volumes.\n\nI would stay again during our next trip to Calgary. Despite being in the middle of no where, the prices are still relatively low, offering great value especially considering the brand new rooms.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;We recently stayed at this hotel during our trip to Calgary. \n\nHere&#x27;s what I loved about it:\n- The lobby is gorgeous. But it&#x27;s not big and grand so don&#x27;t except that. It&#x27;s not a huge hotel, only 3 floors \n- The check in was fast - took about 5 mins, I had reserved on Expedia. Service was friendly. \n- It was quiet. Saw 3 people in the bar area, no one in the halls. It seemed like it was empty which is nice if you like quietness and solitude but not if you like action\n- It&#x27;s super clean and modern. Love the color scheme and the bathroom mirror! The bathroom even comes with heated floors! The hotel is only 4 years old so didn&#x27;t see any wear and tear\n- Free parking\n- Good price and value\n- Rooms were very spacious\n\nHere&#x27;s what I&#x27;m not a fan of:\n- The shower pressure was okay... water was hot but pressure could&#x27;ve been stronger and would prefer shower handle that you can take down\n- It&#x27;s 15 ins away from airport so not that close, also 15-20 mins away from downtown. It&#x27;s actually kind of in the middle of nowhere. So a car is a MUST!&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I love the staying for 2 nights during my trip to Lake Louise for my friend&#x27;s wedding. I stayed at Fairmount for 2 nights and then layby Radisson for 2 nights. Although Radisson has no breath taking view within the hotel property, it provides me a very comfortable room to rest. Location is great not just to the airport, but as well the shops and resturant. The free wifi and parking is a bounus. Everything there are new and up to date. I feel like I am living in a studio unit of a condo. Thank you for the friendly staff to make my trip more relaxing .&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;This is a very nice hotel in Calgary.  I chose it because I do a lot of business with the Radisson in Edmonton and have always been happy with them.\n\nThe rooms are spacious and bright, bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom door slides open and closed and there&#x27;s no way to lock it.  Which is fine, but it seemed a little odd.\n\nThere was a nice big window in the room, but it overlooked a junkyard.  Not so great during the day, but at night we were able to cozy up and watch the thunder storm.\n\nThe reason I can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars.. a few hours after we checked out, I received a phone call asking if I took the bedskirt.\n\nYes... the bedskirt.... Whos steals a bedskirt?  I don&#x27;t think the guy was convinced that we didn&#x27;t take it..&quot;,

When I got there, I realized that this was the Stephen Walker who plays hockey with my husband!  Go figure.  Luckily, it was great, so I had nothing to complain about (or any pain) the next time I went to watch his hockey game.&quot;,
